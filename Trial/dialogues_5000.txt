permanently <unk> ? are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has n't this <unk> ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?	look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?
look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?	and is n't there a movie in the works about you ?
and is n't there a movie in the works about you ?	we 're in negotiations , that 's correct .
we 're in negotiations , that 's correct .	but does n't the son of sam law prevent criminals from <unk> from their crimes ?
but does n't the son of sam law prevent criminals from <unk> from their crimes ?	that does n't apply to me because i 'm not a criminal . i 'm not a criminal ! i was n't convicted .
space <unk> 5 - lounge	well , how nice to see you again , elena . you 're looking wonderful .
continued	i 'm afraid i 've only got a few minutes , but i 'd love to .
continued	she 's wonderful .
continued	well , i suppose they 've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment .
continued	how did they manage to do that without any communication ?
continued	i 'm sorry , dr. <unk> , but i 'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
continued	we 're trying to get there . i hope we can .
hi . frank ... coming in , please .	right . just a sec .
right . just a sec .	okay .
okay .	okay , come on down .
dave , if you 've a minute , i 'd like your advice on something .	sure , what is it ?
sure , what is it ?	well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying .
well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying .	what 's up ?
what 's up ?	it 's about my salary <unk> .
it 's about my salary <unk> .	yes ?
yes ?	well i got the papers on my official <unk> to <unk> two weeks before we left .
that 's right . well , naturally , i did n't say anything to payroll . i assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . but it 's been almost three weeks now and i 'm still being paid as an <unk> .	interesting that you mention it , because i 've got the same problem .
interesting that you mention it , because i 've got the same problem .	really .
really .	yes .
yes .	yesterday , i finally called the accounting office at mission control , and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the <unk> <unk> for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either .
not really . they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall , and that we 're being charged against <unk> <unk> accounting offices .	it 's possible .
it 's possible .	well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?	i do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .
i do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .	i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .	no . i never did , either .
i suppose the idea was <unk> training .	i suppose so . though , of course , there 's a more <unk> explanation .
i suppose so . though , of course , there 's a more <unk> explanation .	oh ?
oh ?	yes . you must have heard the <unk> that went around during <unk> <unk> .
yes . you must have heard the <unk> that went around during <unk> <unk> .	no , as a matter of fact , i did n't .
no , as a matter of fact , i did n't .	oh , well , apparently there 's something about the mission that the sleeping <unk> know that we do n't know , and that 's why we were trained <unk> and that 's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard .
i do n't know . all i heard is that there 's something about the mission we were n't told .	that seems very unlikely .
that seems very unlikely .	yes , i thought so .
yes , i thought so .	of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .	how ?
how ?	just ask hal . it 's <unk> they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from hal .
just ask hal . it 's <unk> they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from hal .	that 's true .
not really . though , it is strange when you think about it . it did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training .	yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .
yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .	i know . it would be almost <unk> .
i know . it would be almost <unk> .	but not completely <unk> ?
but not completely <unk> ?	i suppose it is n't <unk> impossible .
i suppose it is n't <unk> impossible .	i guess it is n't .
i guess it is n't .	still , all we have to do is ask hal .
well , that 's something .	yes , i do n't know what to make of it .
yes , i do n't know what to make of it .	i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .	yes , but it 's more likely that the <unk> on our testing gear are too low .
yes , but it 's more likely that the <unk> on our testing gear are too low .	anyway , it 's just as well that we replace it . better safe than sorry .
good morning . how 's it going ?	are you reasonably awake ?
are you reasonably awake ?	oh , i 'm fine , i 'm wide awake . what 's up ?
oh , i 'm fine , i 'm wide awake . what 's up ?	well ... hal 's reported the <unk> about to fail again .
well ... hal 's reported the <unk> about to fail again .	you 're kidding .
you 're kidding .	no .
i do n't know . hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure .	two units in four days . how many <unk> do we have ?
two units in four days . how many <unk> do we have ?	two more .
two more .	well , i hope there 's nothing wrong with the assembly on those . <unk> wise we 're out of business .
hal ?	yes .
it 's the last one .	well , now that we 've got one that 's actually failed , we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it .
i did n't do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .	i guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .
i guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .	i guess not .
i guess not .	i think i 'll have to go out and burn them off .
i think i 'll have to go out and burn them off .	roger .
i 'm sorry , frank , but i do n't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .	he 's got a point .
sorry to interrupt the <unk> , dave , but i think we 've got a problem .	what is it , hal ?
what is it , hal ?	my <unk> . shows an <unk> failure of the antenna <unk> unit .
the unit is still operational , dave . but it will fail within seventy-two hours .	i understand hal . we 'll take care of it . please , let me have the hard copy .
not now , hal , i 'd like to talk to you about something .	sure , dave , what 's up ?
sure , dave , what 's up ?	you know that we checked the two <unk> that you reported in <unk> failure condition ?
you know that we checked the two <unk> that you reported in <unk> failure condition ?	yes , i know .
yes , i know .	you probably also know that we found them okay .
you probably also know that we found them okay .	yes , i know that . but i can assure you that they were about to fail .
i 'm not questioning your word , dave , but it 's just not possible . i 'm not capable of being wrong .	hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?	look , dave , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the <unk> , and with your test gear .
look , dave , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the <unk> , and with your test gear .	okay , hal , well let 's see the way things go from here on .
naturally , dave , i 'm not pleased that the <unk> has failed , but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and <unk> . i certainly would n't want to be disconnected , even temporarily , as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history .	i 'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .
i 'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .	well , do n't worry about it .
well , do n't worry about it .	and do n't you worry about it .
and do n't you worry about it .	is your confidence in me fully restored ?
is your confidence in me fully restored ?	yes , it is , hal .
yes , it is , hal .	well , that 's a relief . you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission .
too bad about frank , is n't it ?	yes , it is .
yes , it is .	i suppose you 're pretty broken up about it ?
i suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be <unk> for another three months .	the antenna has to be replaced .
the antenna has to be replaced .	<unk> the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
<unk> the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .	it does n't have to be , hal . it 's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .
it does n't have to be , hal . it 's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .	i do n't really agree with you , dave . my <unk> memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission <unk> .
if you 're determined to <unk> the crew now , i can handle the whole thing myself . there 's no need for you to trouble .	i 'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .
i 'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .	look , dave your 've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .
look , dave your 've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .	hal , switch to manual <unk> control .
hal , switch to manual <unk> control .	i do n't like to <unk> myself , dave , but it would be much better now for you to rest . you 've been involved in a very <unk> situation .
i can tell from the tone of your voice , dave , that you 're upset . why do n't you take a stress pill and get some rest .	hal , i 'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual <unk> control .
hal , i 'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual <unk> control .	i 'm sorry , dave , but in <unk> with <unk> <unk> , quote , when the crew are dead or <unk> , the computer must assume control , <unk> . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to <unk> <unk> exercise it .
i 'm sorry , dave , but in <unk> with <unk> <unk> , quote , when the crew are dead or <unk> , the computer must assume control , <unk> . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to <unk> <unk> exercise it .	hal , unless you follow my instructions , i shall be forced to disconnect you .
i am prepared to do that anyway .	i know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and <unk> <unk> in the mission .
i know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and <unk> <unk> in the mission .	listen to me very carefully , hal . unless you immediately release the <unk> control and follow every order i give from this point on , i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete <unk> .
continued	yes , i remember you mentioning it . i got mine about the same time .
continued	did they have any explanation for this ?
continued	well , what is it ?
<unk>	well ... it 's silly , but ... if you want to , why do n't you ?
continued	still , you really do n't believe it , do you ?
continued	well , the only important <unk> of the mission are : where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming back , and ... why are we going ?
i 'm at space station five , darling . how are you ?	i 'm fine , daddy . when are you coming home ?

thank you .	well , how 's it going back there ?
well , i 've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .	i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .	berkeley told me that they think it came from <unk> on a returning mars flight .
berkeley told me that they think it came from <unk> on a returning mars flight .	yes , well , whatever it is , they 're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
yes , well , whatever it is , they 're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .	i was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .

how is gregor ?	he 's fine . but i 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .
he 's fine . but i 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .	well , where are all of you off to ?
<unk> control came on the air just long enough to transmit their <unk> .	well , that does sound very odd .
are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink ?	no , thank you ... and i 'm afraid now i really must be going .
no , thank you ... and i 'm afraid now i really must be going .	well , i hope that you and your wife can come to the <unk> . conference in june .

how do you do , mr. miller ?	i 'm terribly sorry . i was just on my way down to meet you . i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time , and i was on my way out of the office when , suddenly , the phone rang .

yes , i think so . just about then .	i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were <unk> .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were <unk> .	yes , it 's coming along very well .
oh , i really do n't have time for a drink . if it 's all right i 'll just sit for a minute and then i 've got to be off .	are you quite sure ?
are you quite sure ?	yes , really , thank you very much .
well , as it happens , i 'm on my way up to the moon	are you , by any chance , going up to your base at <unk> ?
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at <unk> ?	yes , as a matter of fact , i am .
i 'm sorry , but i 'm not sure i know what you mean .	well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at <unk> .
well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at <unk> .	really ?
really ?	yes . well , for one thing , whenever you phone the base , all you can get is a recording which <unk> that the phone lines are temporarily out of order .
yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it 's been going on for the past ten days .	you mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
you mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?	that 's right .
that 's right .	i see .
yes , and i 'm <unk> there 's going to be a bit of a row about it . denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the <unk> . convention .	yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely .
yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely .	fortunately , they did .
fortunately , they did .	well , i 'm glad about that .
dr. floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem <unk> to discuss , may i ask you a <unk> question ?	certainly .
certainly .	quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at <unk> . something , <unk> , of an unknown origin . is this , in fact , what has happened ?
this epidemic could easily spread to our base , dr. floyd . we should be given all the facts .	dr. <unk> ... i 'm not permitted to discuss this .
dr. floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under <unk> ?	i 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under <unk> as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security <unk> are to be <unk> in writing from <unk> one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be <unk> time for a full study to be made of the situation before any <unk> <unk> can be given to making a public announcement .
yes , it does . the <unk> structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .	how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?	by the <unk> between the mother rock and the fill .
by the <unk> between the mother rock and the fill .	any clue as to what it is ?
any clue as to what it is ?	not really . it 's completely <unk> . no sound or energy sources have been <unk> . the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it . a laser drill
but you do n't have any idea as to what it is ?	tomb , shine , <unk> spare part , take your choice .
any ideas about the <unk> ?	well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something <unk> , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a <unk> <unk> device ?
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something <unk> , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a <unk> <unk> device ?	has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?	i do n't think it has , but i 'd like to check that . simpson , what 's the log on that ?
oh , <unk> . it 's the first real sleep i 've had for the past two days .	there 's nothing like <unk> sleep for a complete rest .
there 's nothing like <unk> sleep for a complete rest .	when do we arrive at <unk> ?
when do we arrive at <unk> ?	we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?	oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i 'm just fine .
thank you .	incidentally , dr. floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
incidentally , dr. floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?	what do you mean ?
what do you mean ?	well ... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at <unk> . we have to stay inside for the time it take to <unk> - about twenty-four hours . and then we 're going to back empty .
well ... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at <unk> . we have to stay inside for the time it take to <unk> - about twenty-four hours . and then we 're going to back empty .	i see .
i see .	i take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at <unk> ?
well , i 'll tell you why i ask . you see , i 've got a girl who works in the <unk> department of the <unk> <unk> and i have n't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so , and with all these stories one hears , i 'm a little concerned about her .	i see . well , i 'm sorry about that . i would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .
i see . well , i 'm sorry about that . i would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .	yes , well , i would n't have been too concerned about it , except i 've heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , i 've heard that ten people have died already .
well , fine . thanks very much , anyway , and i hope you do n't mind me asking ?	no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .
no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .	well , thank you very much , and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable .

they hired you . you 're like , a private detective ?	that 's exactly what i am .

hey , what 's wrong with you -- let 's see a smile .	had kind of a long night .
had kind of a long night .	dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .
dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .	no , the dan part was nice ...
good to see you again , mr. grey . i 've got to go find dan .	yeah , before they <unk> his <unk> .
it was no accident . it was krueger . he used to get in through my dreams , but not anymore . he 's found some other way .	alice , it 's no dream . i 'm sorry ... dan 's dead .
have you visited the little boy on my floor ? jacob , the one who looks kind of sad ?	there are n't any little boys on your floor .
there are n't any little boys on your floor .	he must 've wandered up from the children 's ward . i just wondered what was wrong with him .
did everyone call everyone ?	they 're waiting for us ... but let 's keep this dream stuff between you and me .
what 's that got to do with it ?	when dan died you were n't even asleep . you said so . end of story .
it was just an accident . like with dan .	no accident . i tried to warn all of you about krueger .
i do n't understand what 's happening . krueger has to use my dreams , but he got to dan and <unk> while i was awake . how 's he doing it ?	why do n't you two stick to reality .
you had me scared on the phone . what 's wrong with the baby ?	i think krueger 's trying to do something to it .
oh , alice ... no . honey , i love you but you 're going to have to get a hold of yourself ...	mark knows i 'm not crazy . ask him to show you his hands .
i really think you need to calm down now , okay ?	i just ca n't figure out how he 's getting in when i 'm awake ...
i am your friend , and i 'm worried sick about you . but , you 're like a locked safe . you 've got ta start dealing with reality .	krueger is reality .
krueger is reality .	and so is your baby . you 've got more than just yourself to think of now !
and so is your baby . you 've got more than just yourself to think of now !	what do you think i 'm doing ? look . whether you believe it or not , krueger is back . he 's after the baby and if i do n't try to do something about it , who will ? ?
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman . why do n't you take off - leave <unk> and cool out somewhere for a while ?	goddamn it , <unk> ! you do n't just run away from this guy ! he finds you in your dreams .
look ... we 're all tired . none of us had any sleep since friday night ...	that 's the only reason you 're alive ...
are you alright ?	yeah ... so that 's him . and you 're not crazy .
you think that 's the place she 's buried ?	if they actually bothered to bury her .
what ?	jacob . we 've got to get to amanda before it 's too late .
but how are we gon na --	we 've got to go to the asylum and find her body . mark said her soul 's trapped with it -- that 's why she ca n't come to me . it must be !
you do good work , alice .	so did dan .
he sure loves to stay awake .	that 's okay . he 's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep .
give up , mark , it 's hopeless .	i think i 'm starting to wear her down . have some anyway .
not to mention the <unk> of <unk> .	<unk> , come on . one burger with me ?
my dad 's got this thing about drinking in the house .	well we got ta do something !
i 've got to write some of this down .	that 's why it 's my fault dan 's dead .
mark , are you okay ?	yeah . i 'm just aces .
i want to talk to both you guys about <unk> . and ...	i 'm very fucking sorry , but <unk> is dead today . could we interest you in someone else ?
i thought about that .	she must 've fallen asleep at the table ...
then get out !	mark !
do you think i 'm an idiot ... for being in love with her ?	nobody thinks that .
maybe it was her mother who killed her , with all that <unk> perfect shit .	it was n't her mother . the only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the <unk> party .
tell me some more about this krueger guy .	why do n't i go make some coffee . there 's a lot to tell .
who 's jacob ?	my baby !
my baby !	what , you named it already ?
whoa , slow down . how 're you gon na hide from a guy like that , leave the planet ?	i do n't know !
where are you going ?	i 'm going to see what else i can find out about mr. fred krueger
i could n't do that , mark . he 's my last link with dan ... no , i want him .	then we 'll find another way .
they think i 'm nuts .	that 's their problem .
no , it 's our problem , mark . if i do n't deal with this , they really might try to take jacob . you said she committed suicide ?	that 's what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger 's trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .
that 's what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger 's trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .	meaning ?
they could n't prove it . no body ! nuns <unk> themselves off is bad for business .	but i 've seen her grave .
but i 've seen her grave .	empty plot . memorial stone . vacant . they never did put her under . cool , huh ?
poor woman ...	no shit .
i do n't understand .	she killed herself . her soul 's gon na be in <unk> .
yeah , when are you gon na come to your senses ?	next life . oh , what 's that ?
next life . oh , what 's that ?	my <unk> love . have some .
meet me later . <unk> . cherry pie . banana <unk> . and no mom !	<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ... and no <unk> career .
that club sucks , they card everybody . let 's just party at your place .	you know my mother -- get real . what about alice 's ?
he 's right . sometimes i feel like i 'm living with <unk> .	who ?
who ?	oh , he was this ancient guy i read about who like , killed his kids 'cause they did n't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should .
oh man ! i could 've gone all night without looking at that .	i do n't believe this ... all that <unk> you paint in the <unk> and you 're <unk> ?
these things are wild ... what do you think ?	makes you look like a nun --
all right kids , i tell you what we 're gon na do . i 've got swimming practice until <unk> today ...	yeah ...
yeah ...	that means they 're gon na give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i 'm done .
have another one , sounds like you need it .	<unk> , i 'm done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . are n't you going in ?
<unk> , i 'm done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . are n't you going in ?	nah . it 's getting too cold for me , and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair . she 's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night .
stop saying that , it 's bullshit .	i want to talk about the baby .
look . dan 's parents were pushing him . pushing him hard . he was bitching about it at the party last night . he was under pressure . we all are .	pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy .
bottom line , alice . anybody , supernatural or not , that wants to hurt you - he 'll have to go through us first .	all of us . right ?
dan . and he 's taking alice with him -- pretty good dive <unk> . you 've been practicing .	two hours a day , six days a week .
vomit ?	faint .
why do n't you shut up and let her talk ! two of us died in the last two days , does that strike you as particularly normal ? !	mark ...
mark ...	i 'm not finished - i loved <unk> . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i 'd like to hear about it !
i 'm not finished - i loved <unk> . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i 'd like to hear about it !	i ca n't listen to this .
it 's okay .	stick around , please ?
you , too ?	he invited me to his house last night .
i should have <unk> , when i heard that <unk> . ' i thought it was your father .	it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .
it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .	how is he - ?
how is he - ?	it was <unk> . he 'll be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .
it was <unk> . he 'll be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .	and they thought < u > you < /u > could re- place the skipper ?
you could train someone else .	not in two days . look : do you think i < u > wanted < /u > to come ? if it did n't mean so much to dad - proving his <unk> - it 's the last thing i 'd want !
what is it ?	your <unk> . ' this came for you .
your <unk> . ' this came for you .	my father ! he 's not - ?
my father ! he 's not - ?	dead ? matter of fact , he 's much better . he 's left the hospital .
what did you mean : i 'm <unk> ? '	your father can be in <unk> , alaska , tomorrow . we have two choices : ask them to send him out in a <unk> ' , and take you off , or the shark can put back into <unk> ...
you <unk> school boys ' are all alike , are n't you ? anybody who does n't happen to think like a little <unk> puppet is , <unk> <unk> , a coward !	< u > you < /u > said it . but i wo n't argue -
wearing a uniform does n't <unk> an automatic <unk> on courage , < u > commander < /u > ! it just so happens i 'm < u > not < /u > a coward - physical or mental - and before i 'd risk my father 's life ...	we 're < u > all < /u > risking our lives !
we 're < u > all < /u > risking our lives !	that may be . but dad stays where < u > he < /u > is , and i 'm staying here !
that may be . but dad stays where < u > he < /u > is , and i 'm staying here !	you 're really a <unk> <unk> , are n't you ?
you 're really a <unk> <unk> , are n't you ?	perhaps . but the idea of <unk> going to < u > school < /u > to spend my < u > life < /u > at a <unk> <unk> that should have disappeared with the <unk> - i 'm referring to war - < u > that < /u > strikes me as the < u > worst < /u > <unk> of all - being <unk> yellow !
perhaps . but the idea of <unk> going to < u > school < /u > to spend my < u > life < /u > at a <unk> <unk> that should have disappeared with the <unk> - i 'm referring to war - < u > that < /u > strikes me as the < u > worst < /u > <unk> of all - being <unk> yellow !	you mean < u > nothing < /u > is worth fighting for ?
you mean < u > nothing < /u > is worth fighting for ?	peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win < u > those < /u > by fighting wars , and < u > i 'll < /u > show you an idiot !
peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win < u > those < /u > by fighting wars , and < u > i 'll < /u > show you an idiot !	you may not < u > win < /u > them . but without men like your father , to <unk> ' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they 'd have disappeared , < u > long < /u > ago !
unidentified flying objects .	then ... this is a <unk> <unk> ? '
that 's enough , <unk> . i 've told you before , wearing boards on your shoulders , and <unk> with a stiff spine does n't <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk> bone - !	- any more than being the son of captain <unk> does !
however our ideas disagree , as i 've said before , i 'm < u > not < /u > a coward ! and it happens you 've got no choice : either < u > i < /u > take you down there , in the <unk> , or you do n't get there -	i 'd sooner swim !
they 're so remote - cold - beautiful , the stars . but now - i wonder -	yes ?
yes ?	which is the one - we have to worry about ?
maybe - just <unk> ' - when their ship does n't return - they 'll decide not to come here , after all .	but if they < u > do < /u > ?
but if they < u > do < /u > ?	i do n't know .
i do n't know .	i would n't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father -
i would n't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father -	and his <unk> ' son ! we 'll give 'em a < u > rough < /u > < u > reception < /u > , wo n't we ?
now , dave old buddy , you know you 're exaggerating - what do you think of this husband of yours ? on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the <unk> and his <unk> and firing officer . but unfortunately , in the case of lieutenant dave <unk> of the tiger shark and myself -	but julie 's a nice girl , and i 've seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !
but julie 's a nice girl , and i 've seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !	helen . i appeal to you -
reef !	so they caught up with you , too ?
so they caught up with you , too ?	at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is <unk> 's birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now -
at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is <unk> 's birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now -	< u > that 's < /u > the worst possible moment ?
< u > that 's < /u > the worst possible moment ?	what could be worse than <unk> ing a little girl ?
what could be worse than <unk> ing a little girl ?	disappointing a < u > big < /u > girl !
you 've asked why i stay a bachelor ? there goes the best reason i know !	huh ?
huh ?	i might have a son like < u > that ! < /u >
i guess skipper <unk> re- tired before you <unk> at the academy , did n't he ?	i guess .
i guess .	one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero - in the best sense of the word - in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .
one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero - in the best sense of the word - in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .	so ?

but < u > they 're < /u > not skipper <unk> 's son ! it broke his heart . then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest , sincere son of a <unk> father ' - captain <unk> resigned from the navy . oh , he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the <unk> ' - but it broke him , all the same .	have you ever talked to carl - tried to see his side ?
have you ever talked to carl - tried to see his side ?	<unk> ' side ? i 've seen it , all right . a nice , bright yellow !

we 're stuck tight !	skipper ! look at the depth gauge !
you 've got to let us try , skipper --	<unk> ? '

you all wait here . i 'm going inside , take a look .	not < u > alone < /u > , you 're not !
how about that ! the bow drove half through her , but she sealed herself right up .	what 's more important - there 's our problem . the bow ram - the <unk> are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !
what 's more important - there 's our problem . the bow ram - the <unk> are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !	i think you 're right .
i think you 're right .	go back and tell dr. <unk> . have him report to the skipper .
yeah ?	listen ! hear that ?
i do n't hear anything . maybe you 've been down here too long . why do n't you go back up and -	strange you did n't hear it . <unk> <unk>

is there any way out of it ?	seems to be all around ...
seems to be all around ...	what about down ?
what about down ?	i ... do n't know !
course and speed ?	speed ... about twenty-two knots . course ... due north !
a mass of <unk> stuff came out of the thing , and caught our torpedo !	what ? ? ?

now they feel it ... down below .	radiation level ... constantly rising ...
excuse me , captain - there may be one last , desperate chance - a <unk> shot ...	anything -- -
anything -- -	it 's possible i could <unk> one of the torpedo guidance systems to the <unk> - so it would <unk> ' on the <unk> when he rises from the pole .
it 's possible i could <unk> one of the torpedo guidance systems to the <unk> - so it would <unk> ' on the <unk> when he rises from the pole .	what about time ... ?

here 's my theory . twombley , <unk> of illegal union loans or whatever , starts <unk> around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son-in-law is involved .	so mel gordon would n't want a professional hit . that 'd make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .

we got ta figure on them getting into the complex .	that 's right . so we put up <unk> <unk> at these <unk> ... ... and seal these <unk> here and here . then they can only come at us from these two <unk> and we create a free field of fire for the other two <unk> units , here .
they 're in the approach corridor .	on my way .
now many ?	ca n't tell . lots . d gun 's down to twenty . ten . it 's out .
newt time then can walk right up and knock .	but they do n't know that . they 're probably looking for other ways to get in . that 'll take them awhile .

what do you mean , sire ?	well , i mean occasionally it seems to have , how shall one say ? how shall one say , director ?
i do n't understand . there are just as many notes , majesty , as are required . neither more nor less .	my dear fellow , there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening . i think i 'm right in saying that , are n't i , court composer ?
my dear , young man , do n't take it too hard . your work is <unk> . it 's quality work . and there are simply too many notes , that 's all . cut a few and it will be perfect .	which few did you have in mind , majesty ?

majesty , may i ask you to do me the greatest favour ?	what is it ?
what is it ?	may i introduce my father ? he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to <unk> . he would so much like to kiss your hand . it would make his whole stay so <unk> for him .

it is not your place to ask questions . is it true ?	well , yes , i admit it is .
well , yes , i admit it is .	would you tell me why ?
would you tell me why ?	well , majesty , it is only a comedy .
mozart , i am a <unk> man . i do not <unk> things <unk> . when i do , i have good reason . <unk> is a bad play . it <unk> up hatred between the classes . in france it has caused nothing but <unk> . my own dear sister <unk> writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people . i do not wish to see the same fears starting here .	sire , i swear to your majesty , there 's nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .
sire , i swear to your majesty , there 's nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .	i think you are rather innocent , my friend . in these dangerous times i can not afford to <unk> our <unk> or our people simply over a theatre piece .
but , majesty , this is just a <unk> . it 's a piece about love .	ah , love again .
ah , love again .	but it 's new , it 's entirely new . it 's so new , people will go mad for it . for example , i have a scene in the second act - it starts as a <unk> , just a man and wife <unk> . suddenly the wife 's <unk> little maid comes in <unk> - a very funny situation . <unk> turns into <unk> . then the husband 's equally screaming valet comes in . <unk> turns into quartet . then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes <unk> , and so on . on and on , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ! how long do you think i can sustain that ?

forgive me , majesty . i 'm a vulgar man . but i assure you , my music is not .	you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .
you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .	sire , the whole opera is finished . do you know how much work went into it ?
<unk> . well then , we should make some effort to acquire him . we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?	i agree , majesty , but i 'm afraid it 's not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the <unk> .
i agree , majesty , but i 'm afraid it 's not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the <unk> .	very small pay , i imagine . i 'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer . say , an opera in german for our national theatre .
<unk> . what do you say , <unk> ?	in my opinion , it is time we had a piece in our own language , sir . plain german . for plain people .
yes , sir .	well . there it is .
well , what do you have for me today ?	your majesty , herr mozart -

i do n't think it was really decided , director .	oh , german ! german ! please let it be german .
my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point . do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ?	why not ? it 's charming . i mean , i do n't actually show <unk> <unk> their ! their ! it 's not <unk> ! it 's highly moral , majesty . it 's full of proper german <unk> . i swear it . absolutely !
well done , mozart . really quite fine .	baron !
mozart -	sire , only opera can do this . in a play , if more than one person speaks at the same time , it 's just noise . no one can understand a word . but with music , with music you can have twenty <unk> all talking at once , and it 's not noise - it 's a perfect harmony . is n't that marvelous ?

it was <unk> . what was god up to ? here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god 's gift and there was mozart <unk> his in all directions - even though engaged to be married ! - and no <unk> at all ! was it possible i was being tested ? was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense , no matter how painful ? that was very possible . all the same , why him ? why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility ? my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man . for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts . i could n't stop them .	did you try ?
did you try ?	every day . sometimes for hours i would pray !
yes , father . yes ! so much for my vow of <unk> . what did it matter ? good , patient , <unk> , <unk> - what did it matter ? had goodness made me a good composer ? i realized it absolutely then - that moment : goodness is nothing in the <unk> of art . and i was nothing to god .	you can not say that !

oh my son , my poor son !	do n't pity me . pity yourself . you serve a wicked god . he killed mozart , not i . took him , <unk> him away , without pity . he destroyed his beloved rather than let a <unk> like me get the <unk> share in his glory . he does n't care . understand that . god cares nothing for the man he <unk> and nothing either for the man he uses . he broke mozart in half when he 'd finished with him , and threw him away . like an old , worn out <unk> .

when you get to a certain age , you start wondering . about your legacy . i doubt you even remember outpost <unk> --	i do !
i do !	yeah ? i wan na feel like i did when i wrote that . but i 'm 42 , that 's 100 in <unk> . i look at you and see the things that got me here . but somehow got away .
no ! just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself .	okay . i 'm gary .

... do i ?	somebody said i 'm just another <unk> . with <unk> .
somebody said i 'm just another <unk> . with <unk> .	that 's insane . you 're ahead of your time .
that 's insane . you 're ahead of your time .	that 's what i told her . my wife .
could work with a new switch . there may be a few more things hidden .	do n't spend too much time searching . you ever <unk> somebody 's old code before ? it 's a different skill . stay close to the surface . the <unk> secrets are in plain sight . you know the best place to hide a leaf , right ? in a tree .
how 's it going ?	maybe i 'm going too fast .
maybe i 'm going too fast .	too fast ? at least four companies 're on the verge of <unk> <unk> systems , milo , they --
it 's okay . really .	take a look at this . slightly different approach .
you did this -- overnight ?	you 're making me young again .
milo . what 's up ?	well -- you sent for me .
well -- you sent for me .	right ... right .
you really wrote this just today ?	what 're you implying .
what 're you implying .	nothing !
everything i do is under <unk> . the questions they ask , trying to make anything <unk> look sordid . i 'm confused . does n't everybody in business try to get ahead ?	i 'm sure .
i 'm sure .	the purpose of this company is n't to destroy our <unk> any more than the purpose of living is to breath . but the software business is <unk> : you 're a zero or a one . being obsessive is n't a crime . it 's a character <unk> .
it scales , do n't you think ?	definitely .
i heard what happened .	were the <unk> for teddy ?
had you talked to him much lately ?	just once . <unk> i was worried we did n't have anything to talk about , since work was <unk> . non- <unk> .

the wrong place ?	the answer 's not in the box . it 's in the band .
gary , hi .	you look a little tired .
you look a little tired .	i 'm okay . it 's going well !

no . i just went deeper into the machine . <unk> being the geek to having to explain . lying would 've been worse .	... worse ?
... worse ?	cause he was a liar . and i hated him . `` get your head out of that machine , wise up to the real world .

i 'm pretty close . but when i wrote the last contact <unk> , it wiped out a piece of the content <unk> . you know what it 's like , writing software .	i do know . you focus on the big problem . but somewhere down the chain , something breaks down . something gets destroyed . at first it 's upsetting . you feel you 've lost control .

but still , you ca n't say cbs would n't love to break something like --	say there 's just one `` mole '' working there , like barton at the <unk> . how do we know he 's not the guy we 've contacted ? or she ? or the guy she works for ?
time ?	<unk> has a 40 per cent stake in gary 's <unk> device . that also takes out <unk> . `` <unk> <unk> outpost in new venture , '' which means <unk> is out . `` disney <unk> outpost , '' <unk> is out . `` outpost and <unk> in new deal , '' fox is out . any of these places could have a mole . or all of 'em . it 's like a a <unk> loop . we can go to some alternative press place that <unk> people read , get them and us killed . but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a <unk> to something gary 's got a finger in !
how close are you ?	what ?
what ?	he 's got 12 satellites up . he 's got dishes on top of 21 . he 's building this -- <unk> for skywire . let 's use it .
we ca n't just assume they 're standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch . i 'd have to write in an <unk> .	a what ?
a what ?	it 's how <unk> services push <unk> they wan na sell you . you do n't ask for 'em , they just appear . <unk> to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house . and then the quality of the broadcast would n't exactly be digital , that 's 12 months away .

do n't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars ? a million dollars is n't that much money these days .	all right then ... ... five million dollars !

the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police , herr <unk> , a relationship which , no doubt , <unk> in the younger gentlemen 's promotion .	your loyalty to me and your service to the <unk> has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us ; if you succeed , depend on it , your reward will be your discharge from the army , and a bounty of 100 <unk> .
your loyalty to me and your service to the <unk> has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us ; if you succeed , depend on it , your reward will be your discharge from the army , and a bounty of 100 <unk> .	what is the service , sir ?
what is the service , sir ?	there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen , who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast , and wears the red <unk> and star of the pope 's order of the <unk> . he is made for good society , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , without <unk> , fond of women , of good food , of high play , <unk> and discreet .
you are a <unk> ; you served in the army , and left on account of weakness in the <unk> . he <unk> a great deal , and wins . do you know the cards well ?	only a very little , as soldiers do .
only a very little , as soldiers do .	i had thought you more expert . you must find out if the chevalier cheats . he sees the english and austrian <unk> <unk> , and the young men of either ministry sup <unk> at his house . find out what they talk of , for how much each plays , especially if any of them play on parole . if you are able to , read his private letters , though about those which go to the post , you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there . but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes , and by what channel or messenger . he sleeps with the keys of his <unk> with a string around his neck -- twenty <unk> , if you get an impression of the keys .
what are the chevalier 's intentions ?	i am not sure . the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money , he would have to fight for it .
has he sent the challenge yet ?	not yet , but i believe he <unk> to .
you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner . when he comes out to his carriage a couple of <unk> will mount the box , and the <unk> will get his orders to move on .	and his baggage ?
and his baggage ?	oh ! that will be sent after him . i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers , you say ; and at noon , after parade , shall be at the inn . you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair , and will wait for me at the chevalier 's rooms until my arrival . we must force that box . you are a <unk> hound , or you would have got the key long ago .
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family .	the man that marries dorothy <unk> must first kill me -- do you mind that ?
dorothy might love me or not , as she likes , but best will have to fight me before he marries her !	faith , i think you are a lad that 's likely to keep your word .
a pretty day 's work of it you have made , master roderick . knowing your uncle to be <unk> for money , and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred <unk> into the family ? best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so . he takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been <unk> herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past , and missing them all , and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father .	and so i am .
and so i am .	and this is the return you make for his kindness ! did n't he harbor you in his house when your father died , and has n't he given you and your mother , <unk> , your fine house of <unk> yonder ?
and this is the return you make for his kindness ! did n't he harbor you in his house when your father died , and has n't he given you and your mother , <unk> , your fine house of <unk> yonder ?	mark this , come what will of it , i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy <unk> . i 'll follow him if it 's into the church , and meet him there . i 'll have his blood , or he shall have mine . will you take my message to him , and arrange the meeting ?
mark this , come what will of it , i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy <unk> . i 'll follow him if it 's into the church , and meet him there . i 'll have his blood , or he shall have mine . will you take my message to him , and arrange the meeting ?	well , if it must be , it must . for a young fellow , you are the most <unk> i ever saw . no officer , bearing his majesty 's commission , can receive a glass of wine on his nose , without <unk> it -- fight you must , and best is a huge , strong fellow .
well , if it must be , it must . for a young fellow , you are the most <unk> i ever saw . no officer , bearing his majesty 's commission , can receive a glass of wine on his nose , without <unk> it -- fight you must , and best is a huge , strong fellow .	he 'll give the better mark . i am not afraid of him .
he 'll give the better mark . i am not afraid of him .	in faith , i believe you are not ; for a lad i never saw more game in my life . give me a kiss , my dear boy . you 're after my own soul . as long as jack <unk> lives , you shall never want a friend or a second .
have you taken my message to him ?	the meeting is arranged . captain best is waiting for you now .

look here , roderick , my boy ; this is silly business . the girl will marry best , mark my words ; and as sure as she does , you 'll forget her . you are but a boy . best is willing to consider you as such . <unk> 's a fine place , and if you have a mind to take a ride <unk> and see the town for a month , here are twenty <unk> at your service . make best an apology , and be off .	a man of honor dies , but never <unk> . i 'll see the captain hanged before i apologize .
<unk> gave me a <unk> of recognition , but offered no public <unk> of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters , and then , shaking hands with me <unk> , gave me news which i wanted , of my family .	i had news of you in <unk> . faith , you 've begun early , like your father 's son , but i think you could not do better than as you have done . but why did you not write home to your poor mother ? she has sent <unk> letters to you in <unk> .

what , with me on the <unk> ? would you kill poor me ?	well , then , i 'll tell you what i 'd do . i 'd jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .
well , then , i 'll tell you what i 'd do . i 'd jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .	jump twenty feet ! you would n't dare to do any such thing on daisy . there 's the captain 's horse , black george , i 've heard say that captain <unk> --
monster ! your father was a tailor , and you are always thinking of the shop . but i 'll have my revenge , i will ! <unk> , will you see me insulted ?	indeed , miss dorothy , i intend to have his blood as sure as my name 's roderick .
i am at your service , mr. cosgrove . how much do you wish to spend ?	as much as possible .
as much as possible .	as much as possible ?
as much as possible ?	yes , for i wish to entertain <unk> .
yes , for i wish to entertain <unk> .	all the same , you must name an amount .
all the same , you must name an amount .	it is entirely up to you . i want the best .
last month , the duke of <unk> spent no more .	all right , five hundred <unk> .
and , to be sure , i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done , and this was the <unk> <unk> and former government minister , lord west , whose acquaintance i made , as i had so many others , at the gaming table .	do you happen to know <unk> <unk> , the <unk> earl of crabs ?
do you happen to know <unk> <unk> , the <unk> earl of crabs ?	by name only .
by name only .	well , sir , this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majesty 's closet , and one with whom our <unk> <unk> is on terms of considerable intimacy . i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief <unk> for the <unk> of your claim to the <unk> which you propose to get .
have you done , mr. cosgrove ?	yes !
yes !	well , mr. cosgrove , i 'll answer you point by point . the king is <unk> <unk> to make <unk> , as you know . your claim , as you call them , have been laid before him , and his majesty 's gracious reply was , that you were the most <unk> man in his <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> , rather than a <unk> . as for <unk> your support from us , you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself <unk> you please . and , now , as i have a great deal of occupation , perhaps you will do me the favor to retire , or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which i can oblige you .
does this assignment interest you ?	yes , minister , i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain <unk> .
was he cheated ?	in so far as i can tell these things -- no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly .
in so far as i can tell these things -- no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly .	<unk> .
a meeting with the prince of <unk> is impossible .	the prince left him only that choice .
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country .	when is he to go ?
then this must be done tomorrow .	what is to be done ?
what has happened , madam , to annoy your ladyship ?	oh , i am grateful to you , sir . i am the wife of captain <unk> <unk> to join him at <unk> . my chair was stopped by a <unk> ; this great <unk> of a <unk> fell down on his knees , armed as he was , and though there were thirty people in the next field , working , when the <unk> attacked , not one of them would help but , on the contrary , wished him `` good luck . ''
be off to your work , you pack of <unk> , or you will have a good taste of my <unk> . have you lost much ?	everything -- my purse , <unk> <unk> of a hundred <unk> , my jewels , my <unk> , watches . and all because this <unk> coward fell to his knees ...
that fool did n't know what was the meaning of a <unk> bill , which was in the <unk> that the fellow took from me .	i am riding to <unk> myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further <unk> .
i am riding to <unk> myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further <unk> .	but i should n't like to put you to such trouble , mister ... ?
but i should n't like to put you to such trouble , mister ... ?	o'higgins ... <unk> o'higgins .
as you have been robbed of your purse , may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might <unk> before reaching your home ?	that 's very kind of you , mr. o'higgins .
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar <unk> at <unk> <unk> . in every sentence , she mentioned a lord or a person of quality . to the lady 's question about my birth and <unk> , i <unk> that i was a young gentleman of large fortune , that i was going to <unk> for my studies , and that my mother allowed me five hundred per <unk> .	you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in <unk> , where <unk> and <unk> of all countries <unk> . i hope you will do me the honor of accepting <unk> in my own house , where captain <unk> will welcome with delight , my gallant young <unk> .
i have good news for you , mr. cosgrove . the firm of <unk> and <unk> , in the city of london , are prepared to lend you <unk> pounds , <unk> against your interest in the <unk> mines . they will redeem the <unk> against the property , which amount to some 10,000 pounds , and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines . they will lend you the <unk> pounds against the lease income , which they will apply to the loan as it comes in , and they will make a charge of 18 % per <unk> interest on the outstanding loan balance .	mr. <unk> , i have made some difficult loans during the past few years , at very <unk> terms , but 18 % a year interest seems very stiff indeed .
mr. <unk> , i have made some difficult loans during the past few years , at very <unk> terms , but 18 % a year interest seems very stiff indeed .	considering your financial circumstances , mr. cosgrove , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better one .
considering your financial circumstances , mr. cosgrove , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better one .	i am prepared to accept the terms , mr. <unk> .
i am prepared to accept the terms , mr. <unk> .	there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature , and provided that <unk> and <unk> can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> in giving her signature .
there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature , and provided that <unk> and <unk> can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> in giving her signature .	provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> ? are you serious ?
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> ? are you serious ?	may i be quite frank with you ?
may i be quite frank with you ?	yes , of course .
yes , of course .	mister <unk> said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life , and <unk> a <unk> , in which case , she might later <unk> any documents signed by herself while in <unk> , and subject them , at any rate , to a doubtful and expensive <unk> . they were quite <unk> on this point , and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship 's perfect <unk> in the transaction before they would advance a <unk> of their capital .

i see .	when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship 's <unk> , they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth , in their presence , at their <unk> in <unk> lane , london . i requested they come here , and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london , but they <unk> , saying that they did not wish to <unk> the risk of a visit to castle <unk> to negotiate , as they were aware of how other respectable parties , such as <unk> sharp and <unk> had been treated here .

i promise your <unk> a good <unk> if you even so much as go to <unk> 's farm to see him .	yes , papa .
your bother is in america fighting the rebels .	is he all right , papa ?
is he all right , papa ?	yes , he 's fine .
yes , he 's fine .	<unk> was better than you , papa , he used not to swear so , and he taught me many good things while you were away .
i made sir william cosgrove 's acquaintance as usual at the <unk> table . one could not but admire the spirit and <unk> with which he <unk> his favorite <unk> ; for , though worn out with <unk> and a <unk> of diseases , a cripple <unk> about in a chair , and suffering <unk> of agony , yet you would see him every morning , and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth .	hang it , mr. roderick james , you have no more manners than a barber , and i think my black <unk> has been better educated than you ; but you are a young fellow of <unk> and <unk> , and i like you , sir . because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own .
indeed , you are right , sir . look at me . marriage has added forty years to my life . i am dying , a <unk> cripple , at the age of fifty . when i took off lady cosgrove , there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself . fool that i was ! i had enough with my <unk> , perfect freedom , the best society in europe -- and i gave up all these , and married and was miserable . take a warning from me , mr. roderick , and stick to the <unk> . do anything , but marry .	would you have me spend my life all alone ?
would you have me spend my life all alone ?	in truth , sir , yes , but , if you must marry , then marry a <unk> <unk> .
in truth , sir , yes , but , if you must marry , then marry a <unk> <unk> .	the <unk> 's daughter ?
the <unk> 's daughter ?	well , why not a <unk> 's daughter ? no man of sense need <unk> himself or deny himself a single <unk> for his wife 's sake ; on the contrary , if he <unk> the animal properly , he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure , but a comfort in his hours of <unk> . for instance , i have got the <unk> ; who tends me ? a hired valet who <unk> me whenever he has the power . my wife never comes near me . what friend have i ? none in the wide world . men of the world , as you and i are , do n't make friends , and we are fools for our pains .
sir william cosgrove , with his <unk> of <unk> , was dying before us by inches . he was <unk> <unk> up by doctors , and , what with my usual luck , he might be restored to health and live i do n't know how many years . if cosgrove would not die , where was the use of my <unk> his lady ? but my fears were to prove <unk> , for on that very night , patient nature would claim her account .	good evening , mr. james , have you done with my lady ?
good evening , mr. james , have you done with my lady ?	i beg your pardon ?
i beg your pardon ?	come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a <unk> than a fool .
come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a <unk> than a fool .	i think , sir william cosgrove , you have had too much drink . your <unk> , mr. hunt , has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter , of which she is a considerable expert .
gentlemen , see this <unk> youth ! he has been troubled by religious scruples , and has flown for <unk> to my <unk> , mr. hunt , who has asked for advise from my wife , lady cosgrove , and between them both , they are <unk> my <unk> young friend in his faith . did you ever hear of such doctors and such a <unk> ?	faith , sir , if i want to learn good principles , it 's surely better i should apply for them to your lady , and your <unk> than to you ?

well , if my intentions are what you think they are -- if i do wish to step into your shoes , what then ? i have no other intentions than you had yourself . lady cosgrove 's wealth may be great , but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it <unk> ? her rank is <unk> , but not so <unk> as my ambition . i will be sworn to <unk> just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her ; and if i win her , and wear her when you are dead and gone , <unk> , knight , do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will <unk> me ?	is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy one ; my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of <unk> a <unk> ? is n't it a comfort to see her ; like a <unk> <unk> , getting everything ready for her husband 's departure ?
is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy one ; my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of <unk> a <unk> ? is n't it a comfort to see her ; like a <unk> <unk> , getting everything ready for her husband 's departure ?	i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon , knight ?
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon , knight ?	not so soon , my dear , as you may fancy perhaps . why , man , i have been given over many times these four years , and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation . who knows how long i may keep you waiting .
not so soon , my dear , as you may fancy perhaps . why , man , i have been given over many times these four years , and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation . who knows how long i may keep you waiting .	sir , let those laugh that win .
sir , let those laugh that win .	i am sorry for you mr. james . i 'm <unk> to keep you or any gentleman waiting . had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to <unk> my omelette with <unk> ? what are the odds , gentlemen , that i do n't live to see mr. james hang yet ?

they ?	mueller and childs . one of them must 've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper ...
i ... i do n't know ...	what do n't you know ?
what do n't you know ?	this is a lot of information to be getting ... i have to think --
there 's no time to think , ray , we got ta get out of here ! you untie me , we grab the guns , get kendall and nunez , and make a run for it --	no ... no , we can just wait till we get back and then tell the <unk> . 's --
no ... no , we can just wait till we get back and then tell the <unk> . 's --	we wait and i 'm a dead man . i got a black face , a criminal record , and over a hundred other <unk> who 'll testify how much i hated west -- my court martial will take six minutes . it 's either me or them , ray , and you got ta decide right now .
a test will no doubt link you to the killing --	put it down !
you ... i 've seen you around the base . but you ... you 're not army , are you ?	coast guard , special detective detail . we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk .
that 's it . you 're that policeman with friends in low places . tell me , how 's <unk> <unk> doing these days ? those <unk> <unk> must have really been a <unk> --	levi , you got about four hours before armed men show up here , put you on a plane to washington , and lock you in a very small dark room . i suggest you talk to us .
i 've done nothing wrong . i 'm the victim here .	but not the only victim , right ?
but not the only victim , right ?	my , my , my , how did things turn so hostile so quickly ? if i did n't know better , i 'd say you two were out to get me .
my father is a powerful man . over the years he 's used that power to protect me , in one form or another , from certain ... <unk> . i am a homosexual .	senator daddy must be thrilled .
senator daddy must be thrilled .	he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on <unk> occasions to be more discreet about my <unk> , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last four weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ?
he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on <unk> occasions to be more discreet about my <unk> , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last four weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ?	i think you just blew `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' out of the fucking water .
i think you just blew `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' out of the fucking water .	the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled . my father <unk> , so instead , west <unk> me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay .
levi , i do n't know if you 're familiar with <unk> work , but we have this little thing called `` motive '' and you just gave yourself one .	you said you wanted to know what happened -- i 'm telling you the truth .
you said you wanted to know what happened -- i 'm telling you the truth .	what happened to `` degrees '' ?
what happened to `` degrees '' ?	i did n't kill him --
i did n't kill him --	then who did ?
maybe i should n't tell you that . maybe i should tell you i was n't scared at all . but i was ... enough to almost kill him .	but you did n't .
but you did n't .	no . poetic justice , though .
he admitted it .	right in front of us . mueller went after him but we held him back .
why did he come back for you ?	i honestly do n't know . maybe to have someone to cover for him . and i wish i could , but there 's no doubt in my mind he killed those men .
okay . i think that 's it . he rises and walks to the door .	mr. hardy ?
somebody emptied a full clip into him --	stop .
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar --	how many murders did you cover up ? one ? five ? maybe an even ten .
how many murders did you cover up ? one ? five ? maybe an even ten .	can i go to jail for <unk> a guy who 's been shot ?
<unk> attacks are murder on your system . rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer .	my heart <unk> .
is it the truth ?	there 's that word again . as i told you , i was n't in the room when everyone started shooting .
why did you tell us he shot everybody , levi ? you put him in for three murders , the man saved your life --	so i should stay silent about his <unk> ? the guns went off , i ran in , childs shot me , pike and mueller were dead , and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
so i should stay silent about his <unk> ? the guns went off , i ran in , childs shot me , pike and mueller were dead , and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --	dunbar was running out the door ? <unk> ... see that 's where i was confused , because i thought you said nunez was running out the door .
dunbar was running out the door ? <unk> ... see that 's where i was confused , because i thought you said nunez was running out the door .	no . i said dunbar .
no . i said dunbar .	huh . you know , i really thought you said nunez . i thought you said `` dunbar was gone , '' my fault , i got ta check the tape on that . oh , yeah we taped the last interview . this one too . cause it 'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie .
i believe your next line is `` what are you trying to hide ? ''	well ?
well ?	sorry to disappoint . i 'm on <unk> for the injury -- they cloud the mind . you 're right , it was nunez . any more questions ?
dunbar will testify that you were .	then we 'll leave it up to the courts -- his word against mine . what does his father do again ? <unk> ? does n't matter , i 'm sure justice will be served . in any case , my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions , these accusations on his son . he 's quite protective .
something funny , levi ?	i was just thinking of what 's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you .
jail if he 's lucky , the gas chamber if he 's not --	i did n't do anything --
why ?	because of what i saw . who really killed west .
how do you know ?	because i was standing next to him .
or you , levi ? when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him ?	i did n't --
i did n't --	but you ca n't prove it ! you ca n't prove anything until we find the bodies !
you lied to us , levi , you 're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them !	i do n't know --
i do n't know --	where are they !
where are they !	maybe --
maybe --	maybe what --
maybe what --	maybe he ...
how are you ?	been better . i read about what 's been happening with you ... i should have called --
been better . i read about what 's been happening with you ... i should have called --	what kind of trouble are you in ?
that bad ?	would i have called you if it was n't ? if there was any other way --
would i have called you if it was n't ? if there was any other way --	tell me what i can do .
this is warrant officer julia <unk> , the closest thing we have to an <unk> house investigator .	and here you are going out of house . how 's that make you feel , <unk> ?
the official term for it is `` <unk> '' . by the time beth hit us , i 'd canceled all off base <unk> save one -- a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush . we 're missing three and the sergeant . the <unk> are in their eighth week of the cycle , nobody here knows much about them , up to and including their names . but the sergeant ...	it 's not west , is it ? tell me it 's not west .
a few years ago , the army picked our good buddy as their go to <unk> to <unk> out to the press to talk about the <unk> , <unk> military . he even did the standard video <unk> played to all <unk> basic <unk> across the country .	well , he 's a good soldier .
the exercise was one of his section eight `` private sessions '' . left around <unk> yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at <unk> this morning .	and the problem is you only got three .
and the problem is you only got three .	no , the problem is one 's dead , one 's got a bullet in his arm , and one wo n't talk . the one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up .
no , the problem is one 's dead , one 's got a bullet in his arm , and one wo n't talk . the one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up .	i 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead one ?
i 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead one ?	cadet <unk> <unk> nunez . killed right in front of me .
which gives us about five hours . why 'd you call me ?	the guy in interrogation said he 'd only talk to a cop .
the guy in interrogation said he 'd only talk to a cop .	and i 'm the closest thing to it , right ?
tom , bottom line : i let those kids go out there . if <unk> shows up and i do n't have any answers for them , my career is finished --	i 'm not gon na let that happen .
he 's not done by a <unk> , i can get more out of him --	he can wait . kendall 's out of surgery .
pike killed west , dunbar killed mueller , childs , and nunez .	who killed pike ?
who killed pike ?	someone must have got a shot off . he was n't exactly a moving target .
we 've already been over the terrain twice . nothing .	there was a hurricane , bill , the wind probably moved it .
there was a hurricane , bill , the wind probably moved it .	<unk> <unk> -- you have to have a body to have a crime .

okay , then let 's <unk> the search to include the <unk> in <unk> stadium and the trunk of my car --	without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .
without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .	from dunbar ? i hate to break this to you , but i do n't think he 's gon na be all that <unk> to put himself in for the death penalty .
from dunbar ? i hate to break this to you , but i do n't think he 's gon na be all that <unk> to put himself in for the death penalty .	nevertheless --
nevertheless --	nevertheless what ' ? kendall will testify and that 'll be enough .
nevertheless what ' ? kendall will testify and that 'll be enough .	not for me .
you mean not enough to save you .	<unk> gets here in three hours . try for the confession .
tom , where are you going --	home , i 'm done .
home , i 'm done .	what about the confession ?
you want a confession ? why do n't you confess , bill : people are dead and you do n't give a shit about it ! only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job , you know this is your fault --	what the hell are you talking about --
what the hell are you talking about --	i 'm talking about west ! we had him , bill , we were there . you 're the fucking base commander , you knew what he did to <unk> and you let him go on the way he always he has --
what i said before --	was dead right . you think dunbar 's on the level ?
was dead right . you think dunbar 's on the level ?	yeah .
yeah .	does <unk> agree ?
it 's over . time of death was <unk> . <unk> 's been notified and i called the senator myself . my report will reflect that his medical condition made this <unk> ... you two had no <unk> in the matter .	that 's horseshit and you know it .
that 's horseshit and you know it .	maybe . but it 's my fault and i 'll carry it .
you think you could explain all this to me ?	i would n't know where to start . i guess it was about one man <unk> another . he thought if the other guy got blamed , people would over look his own wrong <unk> .
they 're taking your command , are n't they ?	the senator ...
i 'm sorry , bill .	do n't be . i 'm not cut out to deal with the west 's of the world .
do n't be . i 'm not cut out to deal with the west 's of the world .	you 're a good soldier , bill .
you 're a good soldier , bill .	i thought you said that was n't a compliment .
it was so good , i actually forgot you 're one of the bigger dogs now . the base commander . the one in control . you could n't let him testify , could you ?	what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?	if you let him testify then it would have all come out . west was supposed to take care of it out there , shut nunez up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal tom hardy , figuring if worse came to worse , he 'd cover for you .
if you let him testify then it would have all come out . west was supposed to take care of it out there , shut nunez up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal tom hardy , figuring if worse came to worse , he 'd cover for you .	you 're drunk --
you 're drunk --	i 'm not going to cover for you , bill . not for this .
stay where you are .	or what ? you 've gone round the bend --
or what ? you 've gone round the bend --	west had a partner . someone who knew how to get things done .
what i ca n't understand is why you signed these . if you 'd just let west take care of the paperwork , no one would have known , but you got careless . so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him , too .	that 's preposterous --
that 's preposterous --	<unk> report came back . kendall 's attack was caused by a drug known as <unk> , maybe you 've heard of it . it 's for <unk> . if an <unk> takes enough , it kills them . i checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you 're the only other person who visited kendall .

the colonel saw you shoot nunez , you 're a murderer --	see , ray , this is what we call `` good cop , bad cop '' . she <unk> , i stand up for you , you 're grateful , a bond of trust is established .
baseball ?	i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --	you made me look like an idiot --
you made me look like an idiot --	oh , i 'm sorry , i did n't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- everyone knows good cop , bad cop -- by admitting it i appeared trustworthy .
you really want to make <unk> <unk> chat like that now ?	you 're right . we should sit in silence .

something like that . you ?	i lost a bet .
you 're kidding .	yeah . that 's just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed . truth is ... i do n't know . the whole honor and duty thing . make a difference in the world , crap like that . did n't really work out .

something wrong ?	being back here . gives me the <unk> .
being back here . gives me the <unk> .	not the happiest of memories ?
remember , he 's the son of a senator , so go easy . kid gloves .	got it .
that was kid gloves ?	have no fear , <unk> , we have not yet begun to fight .
but we have to question him -- thought you did n't have cigarettes --	i lied . wait for it ...
`` too neat . '' how long have you been an investigator ?	i do n't think that has anything to do with --
i do n't think that has anything to do with --	that means under a year . let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic . there are no <unk> , no grand mysteries , and no evil puppet masters behind it all , pulling the strings ; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it does n't always make sense but it 's always neat . dunbar 's our guy .
i just ... he came back for kendall . i do n't think he 's capable of murder .	everyone 's capable of murder , <unk> .
look , all we 've got is what kendall says , and he did n't actually witness any deaths except nunez . he found west , he saw mueller and pike , but just their bodies -- he did n't see any crime committed .	well , i 'm sure if he 'd known this was all going to happen he 'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
why the fuck was n't he in restraints ?	i do n't know .
styles could n't <unk> him , he 's a legend --	you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by . it was just a matter of time till somebody <unk> his ass , and you know what ? he deserved it . there 's your confession .
goddammit , hardy , you ca n't just leave --	watch me .
watch me .	you said you owed styles and now you 're gon na turn your back on him ?
west was a monster ! fifteen years ago , i was here , i was section eight , i was pike . fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did , <unk> pike down , making him stand outside all night ? he did that every year , he did that to me . fifteen years ago , i wanted him dead , and now i 'm supposed to care that somebody <unk> him ? sorry , no can do . i tried .	you did more than try . you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes , as an investigator you 're <unk> --
you did more than try . you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes , as an investigator you 're <unk> --	<unk> at taking <unk> , right ?
i was starting to believe you , you know ? that you were n't who everyone said . i guess i was wrong --	oh , spare me the reverse psychology bullshit ! this is n't my `` great second chance '' , <unk> . everyone thinks i 'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that . nobody will ever know what happens here --
oh , spare me the reverse psychology bullshit ! this is n't my `` great second chance '' , <unk> . everyone thinks i 'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that . nobody will ever know what happens here --	but you will .
why do you care ?	because it 's my job . because people are dead . because of the whole honor and duty thing , make a difference in the world , crap like that . we can do this , hardy .
i did n't shoot west ...	what ?
what ?	dunbar ... he said he did n't shoot west . west was n't shot , kendall said he was blown apart by a <unk> grenade and dunbar never saw the body .
at least you and kendall agree on that .	what happened next ?
talk it through : childs , mueller , and nunez know they 're going out on the regular tuesday night drill , hurricane or no hurricane , so they plan it : kill west , pin it on pike .	and they 're smart about it . they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be <unk> , you need a fall guy and for that to work , you have to have a witness .
and they 're smart about it . they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be <unk> , you need a fall guy and for that to work , you have to have a witness .	dunbar .
dunbar .	exactly , someone who 's not involved , who 's word ca n't be questioned . you only let them see what you want them to see , you make them believe , so when the time comes , they 've totally bought into your version of events .
exactly , someone who 's not involved , who 's word ca n't be questioned . you only let them see what you want them to see , you make them believe , so when the time comes , they 've totally bought into your version of events .	they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .	and if they 're asked , that 's what they 'll tell the , world .
and if they 're asked , that 's what they 'll tell the , world .	so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; mueller <unk> out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --
so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; mueller <unk> out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --	kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane <unk> the cabin --
kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane <unk> the cabin --	<unk> the cabin ?
<unk> the cabin ?	and all hell breaks loose . a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz , bang , <unk> , happy ending .
and all hell breaks loose . a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz , bang , <unk> , happy ending .	so why , after dunbar <unk> kendall out from under a house , does the senator 's son try and get us to put his <unk> in the gas chamber ?
so why , after dunbar <unk> kendall out from under a house , does the senator 's son try and get us to put his <unk> in the gas chamber ?	that bugs you too ?
that bugs you too ?	little bit .
little bit .	let 's go talk to bill ...
we 're fucked , i know --	they got their stories straight .
they got their stories straight .	what ?
what ?	what kendall said -- `` the type of guys you do n't feel comfortable going to sleep around . '' that 's what dunbar said about childs to the letter .
what kendall said -- `` the type of guys you do n't feel comfortable going to sleep around . '' that 's what dunbar said about childs to the letter .	are you sure ?
are you sure ?	positive . hardy , they planned this .
why do n't you talk to levi off the record for a second ?	good idea .
that 's a fantastic idea --	see , i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their <unk> ; then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall 's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
i pushed him too hard .	you could n't have known --
you could n't have known --	yeah , i could 've . should 've .
yeah , i could 've . should 've .	you wanted to get the truth .
you wanted to get the truth .	no , i did n't . i wanted to humiliate him . for what he did to dunbar . for fucking over the little guy .
no , i did n't . i wanted to humiliate him . for what he did to dunbar . for fucking over the little guy .	you mean the <unk> accused ?
you wanted to break him .	yeah .
yeah .	so did i .
so what now ?	now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .	think it 'll work ?
think it 'll work ?	nah .
you know , you never told me why you left the army .	it <unk> on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority ... and all i did here was follow orders . it did n't add up . plus , i got kicked out .
it <unk> on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority ... and all i did here was follow orders . it did n't add up . plus , i got kicked out .	for what ?
for what ?	that 's gon na stay my secret .
we were close to something with kendall .	maybe ... maybe we were nowhere near . sometimes mysteries stay mysteries . i have n't by any chance grown on you , have i ?
maybe ... maybe we were nowhere near . sometimes mysteries stay mysteries . i have n't by any chance grown on you , have i ?	no .
no .	good , just making sure .
four --	get in .
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down .	right back where we started .
hardy , what are you doing --	is n't this how your story goes ?
we can tie you to the chair if it 'll work better for you --	hardy , for chrissakes --
hardy , for chrissakes --	where 's west 's body ?
no bodies , no west ...	no death certificates . no crime .

he was your friend .	yeah . but he was a lot of other things , too . thanks .
the thing is , we 've got a real opportunity here . you turn me in tomorrow and we 're both fucked --	what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?	a gay senator 's son who let his sarge get <unk> on a training exercise ? the press 'll <unk> you and your father . his career will be over and it 'll be your fault . but we do this different and you come out a hero .
how ?	mueller . he 's as bad as west and we both know it . now i ca n't do it , cause i 'm tied up , but we get the others to go along --
mueller . he 's as bad as west and we both know it . now i ca n't do it , cause i 'm tied up , but we get the others to go along --	i do n't think i want to hear this --
i do n't think i want to hear this --	someone else can do the deed , it does n't have to be you . maybe nunez too , he 's got a <unk> to follow mueller , but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their sergeant 's killers ! we 'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they <unk> west , all we got ta do is tell the story right .
pike , please --	although that wo n't matter much when <unk> with the murder charge --

we should tell him we 're not going .	oh , yeah , `` excuse me , sergeant , sir , we do n't feel like going out -- we do n't want to get <unk> on . '' he 'll kick our asses from here to cleveland .
they found him . poor fucker was practically blown in half --	poor fucker my ass ...
poor fucker my ass ...	you better watch it , faggot , i 'm not sure you and childs did n't do him --
pike and i got separated --	yeah and he does n't know when --
yeah and he does n't know when --	i remember now , it was before the explosion --
i remember now , it was before the explosion --	oh , you remember now --
oh , you remember now --	i 'm about two seconds away from seeing if <unk> really can fly --
i was freezing from the hurricane --	so you took off your shirt ?
so you took off your shirt ?	to start a fire , goddammit ! what about him , huh ? maybe he <unk> the sarge and changed shirts , brought an extra one in his pack . <unk> think of that ? go ahead , cut him loose ! first chance he gets , he 'll waste the rest of us , that 's how they work --
we just want --	what , `` the truth '' ? please . there are degrees of truth , officer , always degrees . things are not what they seem .
he could n't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own .	he wanted more than that .
he said what ?	`` you 're gon na die tonight , faggot '' . clear as day .
`` you 're gon na die tonight , faggot '' . clear as day .	no one else heard it ?
no one else heard it ?	he <unk> it in my ear .
nunez was chasing dunbar .	because he 'd shot mueller .
because he 'd shot mueller .	but you did n't see it , right ?
but you did n't see it , right ?	like i said , i was in the kitchen . when i came out , mueller and pike were dead , nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone .
pike never confessed .	we 've been making progress , i see .
running out of time , are we ? <unk> <unk> , <unk> , how long till your witnesses fly the coop ?	fifty minutes .
fifty minutes .	not much time to solve the crime . tell me , detective , how did it feel taking blood money from <unk> <unk> ? did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it ?
pike never confessed .	no , but it got you interested , did n't it ? got you to dig . inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little <unk> who stuck their noses where they did n't belong .
dunbar says you were .	then he 's mistaken . you know , i really do n't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
you and dunbar got your stories straight . little details , little <unk> , designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other , asking questions , killing time , until the transport arrives and <unk> you away to where senator daddy can protect you . you think you 're just going to slide out of this ? you 're an accessory to murder , levi , you 're going to jail --	you ca n't threaten me --
it does n't matter , levi . we 're going to find those bodies and when we do , i 'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --	what ?
it wo n't work --	it will and you know why ? because you 're not a person anymore , you 're a cadet in the united states army ; you have no identity , no <unk> warning , and no rights . so i 'm gon na throw you to the wolves , and unlike you , i 'm gon na get away with it , because you 're pissing me off !
enjoy your flight to washington --	wait --
wait --	what .
dunbar 's telling the truth .	wrong answer --
wrong answer --	we did get our stories straight , but not because we killed anyone . it was because i threatened him .
who , levi --	childs .
i told him what had really happened to west . told him to keep quiet about it or i 'd destroy him . because if it came out that i was involved with the whole <unk> scam , my father would be finished .	i scared dunbar into silence . he 's been trying to cover for me the whole time . we got here , you came to see me ... i did n't know if i could trust him with that kind of secret --
i scared dunbar into silence . he 's been trying to cover for me the whole time . we got here , you came to see me ... i did n't know if i could trust him with that kind of secret --	so you <unk> him . the same way childs was going to frame pike .
what happened with nunez ?	he came after us . and i told dunbar he had to kill him ...
hurricane 's due after midnight and we 're still going out ?	<unk> us up , pike . you do n't like it , quit .
what the fuck happened to you --	what the fuck happened to you ? one minute you 're next to me and the next you 're gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas --
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first --	blame the nigger , then , huh ? someone turns up dead , you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
thank god ...	what the fuck are you doing ?
this place is going , mueller . we got ta move --	shut the fuck up . he was gon na cut him loose .
we all know what you did , pike . i do n't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here , but --	where 's your shirt , mueller ?
where 's your shirt , mueller ?	i used it to start the fire --
i used it to start the fire --	still got mine on , not a speck of blood on it . not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours ?
goddammit , ray , we got ta get out of here --	we 're not going anywhere .
cadet michael mueller , i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west --	the fuck are you talking about --
the fuck are you talking about --	you are to be <unk> of all weapons and placed under guard --
you are to be <unk> of all weapons and placed under guard --	bullshit --
bullshit --	until we return to base , and <unk> can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west 's body --
until we return to base , and <unk> can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west 's body --	shut up !
tell him to shut up --	-- failure to <unk> with this arrest is a court <unk> offense in and of itself --
sign here and here . hey , ai n't you the folks workin ' on that whole <unk> from last night ?	yeah .
yeah .	terrible tragedy . one of those section eight boys worked in here . pike . heard he got out okay .
funny . i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning .	no , no that was cadet dunbar --
no , no that was cadet dunbar --	you mean ray dunbar ? well , that ai n't right .
so ?	ma'am , ray dunbar 's black .
this is totally unnecessary --	he asked to see a policeman , we 're getting him a policeman .
he asked to see a policeman , we 're getting him a policeman .	but this guy you called , he 's not even army --
but this guy you called , he 's not even army --	he 's former army and the best i 've ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you 've had three hours with dunbar and have n't gotten a peep , we need to take a different <unk> .
he 's former army and the best i 've ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you 've had three hours with dunbar and have n't gotten a peep , we need to take a different <unk> .	he 's not army , it 's not official --
he 's not army , it 's not official --	then it 's <unk> .
search parties for the others are <unk> out in a ten click radius from the pickup . if they 're hurt and we can get to them in time ...	i called the <unk> corps , the two <unk> we <unk> are to be flown to d.c. on a transport leaving here at <unk> --
you think he did it ?	no --
what do you think ?	it 's too neat .
you want kendall , do n't you ?	he tried to burn dunbar to us . you do n't do that if you 're not involved .
you both know if you do this , if you go after a senator 's son and you 're wrong ... it 's not just me in the hot seat anymore .	we know .
we know .	i 'm giving you a chance to walk away .
what happens to dunbar now ?	gets on his plane in ten minutes , which means you two are done . you 'll understand if i do n't walk you out .
you never told me why you got kicked out of ...	the army kicked you out for drugs ...
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives ! you have chosen to join my army ! this army is my mother , my father , and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin <unk> , do you understand me -- give me a sir , yes , sir !	sir , yes , sir !

then you should n't have started with a question . because people want to answer questions . you should have started with , `` the thing about <unk> is ... ''	the thing about <unk> is you only see 10 percent of them . the other 90 percent is below the water where you ca n't see it . and that 's what it is with you dad . i 'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water .
the thing about <unk> is you only see 10 percent of them . the other 90 percent is below the water where you ca n't see it . and that 's what it is with you dad . i 'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water .	what , you 're seeing down to my nose ? my chin ?

it 's me . <unk> <unk> .	i was <unk> to see the greatest poet of both <unk> and <unk> all the way out in texas .
i do n't believe it !	i want you to know , when you left <unk> it opened my eyes . there was a whole life out there that i was not living . so i <unk> . i saw france , and africa , half of south america . every day a new adventure , that 's my motto .

oh . oh .	hello .
hello .	i was n't expecting you .
are you jenny hill ?	i am . and you 're will . i 've seen your picture , that 's how i recognize you . i almost said something at the store , but it would have been awkward . like this .
how did you know my father ?	this was on his sales route , so he was through here all the time . everyone in town knew him .
were you and my father having an affair ?	wow . wow , you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour .
wow . wow , you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour .	i 've seen him with women . he <unk> . he always has . on some level , i <unk> he was cheating on my mother . i just never had proof .
can i ask you a question ? why did you come here today ? if you found this deed , why did n't you just ask eddie ?	because he 's dying .
look , i do n't know how much you want to know about any of this . you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it . especially this late in the game .	my father talked about a lot of things he never did , and i 'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about . i 'm just trying to <unk> the two .
<unk> , you could n't be the witch , because she was old back when he was young .	no , it 's logical if you think like your father . see , to him , there 's only two women : your mother and everyone else .
no , it 's logical if you think like your father . see , to him , there 's only two women : your mother and everyone else .	you did n't become crazy .
you did n't become crazy .	well , therapy . and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back . i was living in a fairy tale .
thank you . i 'll bet you need to --	yes .
yes .	down the hall on the right . the door sticks . you have to really pull it .
i spent a week in <unk> for the story . it was incredible .	we 'll have to pick up a copy .
i 'm going to get started on dishes .	i 'll help you .
i 'm going to check on him .	i need to lie down for a bit .
i 'm sorry . it seems every hour i have to ...	i know . it was the same when i was carrying will . like <unk> .
do you like it , being pregnant ?	i do .
i do .	i loved it . it sounds peculiar , but i loved every minute of it . i did . eddie was travelling a lot , so he was gone , but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me . a little part of his soul inside me . i could feel it . it was alive and kicking .
it 's bad .	it 's more than they thought . they 're going to stop <unk> .
it 's more than they thought . they 're going to stop <unk> .	you need to go .
you need to go .	probably tonight .
i 'm going with you .	you do n't have to .
you do n't have to .	i 'm going with you .
i talked with your father last night .	did you ?
you never told me how your parents met .	they met at <unk> .
they met at <unk> .	what about the details ? how they fell in love . the circus . the war . you never told me any of that .
what about the details ? how they fell in love . the circus . the war . you never told me any of that .	that 's because most of it never happened .
that 's because most of it never happened .	but it 's romantic .
mmm .	mmm , what ?
mmm , what ?	mmm , what . i know better than to argue romance with a french woman .
do you love your father ?	everyone loves my father . he 's a very <unk> guy .
everyone loves my father . he 's a very <unk> guy .	do you love him ?
you have to understand . when i was growing up , he was gone more than he was here . and i started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else . with another house , another family . he leaves us , he goes to them . or maybe there is no family . maybe he never wanted a family . but whatever it is , maybe he likes that second life better . and the reason he tells all those stories is because he ca n't stand this boring place .	but it 's not true .
but it 's not true .	what is `` true ? '' i 've never heard my father say a single true thing .
look , i know why you like him . i know why everyone likes him . but i need you to tell me i 'm not crazy .	you 're not .
you 're not .	i need you on my side .
i need you on my side .	i am always on your side . and i think you should talk to him .

ruth <unk> offered to pick you up at the airport .	we rented a car .
we rented a car .	you did n't need to do that . you just did n't .
is that dr. bennett 's car ?	he 's up with your father .
how is he ?	he 's impossible . he wo n't eat . and because he wo n't eat , he gets weaker . and because he 's weaker , he does n't want to eat .
he 's impossible . he wo n't eat . and because he wo n't eat , he gets weaker . and because he 's weaker , he does n't want to eat .	how much time does he have left ?
how much time does he have left ?	you do n't talk about those things . not yet .
i do n't know if you 've seen it , but josephine has some photos in the most recent <unk> .	really ! that 's wonderful .
mom , would you say you understand dad ?	of course .
of course .	what i mean is , do you really know what 's going on in his head ?
what i mean is , do you really know what 's going on in his head ?	yes .
yes .	how is that possible ? i mean , you try to ask him a question and suddenly it 's another one of his stories . you ca n't honestly say you know him .
how is that possible ? i mean , you try to ask him a question and suddenly it 's another one of his stories . you ca n't honestly say you know him .	yes , will , i do . and do n't presume things you do n't know .
would you say you understand josephine ?	yes . but that 's a different ...
yes . but that 's a different ...	no it 's not . it 's exactly the same . your father and i met , we dated , and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some <unk> level . just the same as you two .
josephine and i have a lot in common .	yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone 's wife . and i 've been his wife longer than i 've been your mother . you ca n't discount that .
yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone 's wife . and i 've been his wife longer than i 've been your mother . you ca n't discount that .	true . but i 've known him my whole life , and i do n't feel like i know him at all . or ever will .
i know it 's not easy . just remember , he did n't choose to be your father and you did n't choose to be his son . you just ended up together . you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it 'd be just the same . if you ask me , it 's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all .	but i understand you , mom . i always have .
but i understand you , mom . i always have .	well , clearly you do n't . but i 'm not the mystery you 're trying to solve right now .
before i forget , your father has papers in the basement i 'd like you to go through . i would n't know what 's important .	mom , do you know who that is ? blonde hair .
was she one of your teachers ?	no . but it 's weird . she seemed to recognize me .
