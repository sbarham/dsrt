permanently <unk> ? are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has n't this <unk> ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?	look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?
look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?	and is n't there a movie in the works about you ?
and is n't there a movie in the works about you ?	we 're in negotiations , that 's correct .
we 're in negotiations , that 's correct .	but does n't the son of sam law prevent criminals from <unk> from their crimes ?
but does n't the son of sam law prevent criminals from <unk> from their crimes ?	that does n't apply to me because i 'm not a criminal . i 'm not a criminal ! i was n't convicted .
space <unk> 5 - lounge	well , how nice to see you again , elena . you 're looking wonderful .
continued	i 'm afraid i 've only got a few minutes , but i 'd love to .
continued	she 's wonderful .
continued	well , i suppose they 've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment .
continued	how did they manage to do that without any communication ?
continued	i 'm sorry , dr. <unk> , but i 'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
continued	we 're trying to get there . i hope we can .
hi . frank ... coming in , please .	right . just a sec .
right . just a sec .	okay .
okay .	okay , come on down .
dave , if you 've a minute , i 'd like your advice on something .	sure , what is it ?
sure , what is it ?	well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying .
well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying .	what 's up ?
what 's up ?	it 's about my salary <unk> .
it 's about my salary <unk> .	yes ?
yes ?	well i got the papers on my official <unk> to <unk> two weeks before we left .
that 's right . well , naturally , i did n't say anything to payroll . i assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . but it 's been almost three weeks now and i 'm still being paid as an <unk> .	interesting that you mention it , because i 've got the same problem .
interesting that you mention it , because i 've got the same problem .	really .
really .	yes .
yes .	yesterday , i finally called the accounting office at mission control , and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the <unk> <unk> for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either .
not really . they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall , and that we 're being charged against <unk> <unk> accounting offices .	it 's possible .
it 's possible .	well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?	i do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .
i do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .	i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .	no . i never did , either .
i suppose the idea was <unk> training .	i suppose so . though , of course , there 's a more <unk> explanation .
i suppose so . though , of course , there 's a more <unk> explanation .	oh ?
oh ?	yes . you must have heard the <unk> that went around during <unk> <unk> .
yes . you must have heard the <unk> that went around during <unk> <unk> .	no , as a matter of fact , i did n't .
no , as a matter of fact , i did n't .	oh , well , apparently there 's something about the mission that the sleeping <unk> know that we do n't know , and that 's why we were trained <unk> and that 's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard .
i do n't know . all i heard is that there 's something about the mission we were n't told .	that seems very unlikely .
that seems very unlikely .	yes , i thought so .
yes , i thought so .	of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .	how ?
how ?	just ask hal . it 's <unk> they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from hal .
just ask hal . it 's <unk> they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from hal .	that 's true .
not really . though , it is strange when you think about it . it did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training .	yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .
yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .	i know . it would be almost <unk> .
i know . it would be almost <unk> .	but not completely <unk> ?
but not completely <unk> ?	i suppose it is n't <unk> impossible .
i suppose it is n't <unk> impossible .	i guess it is n't .
i guess it is n't .	still , all we have to do is ask hal .
well , that 's something .	yes , i do n't know what to make of it .
yes , i do n't know what to make of it .	i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .	yes , but it 's more likely that the <unk> on our testing gear are too low .
yes , but it 's more likely that the <unk> on our testing gear are too low .	anyway , it 's just as well that we replace it . better safe than sorry .
good morning . how 's it going ?	are you reasonably awake ?
are you reasonably awake ?	oh , i 'm fine , i 'm wide awake . what 's up ?
oh , i 'm fine , i 'm wide awake . what 's up ?	well ... hal 's reported the <unk> about to fail again .
well ... hal 's reported the <unk> about to fail again .	you 're kidding .
you 're kidding .	no .
i do n't know . hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure .	two units in four days . how many <unk> do we have ?
two units in four days . how many <unk> do we have ?	two more .
two more .	well , i hope there 's nothing wrong with the assembly on those . <unk> wise we 're out of business .
hal ?	yes .
it 's the last one .	well , now that we 've got one that 's actually failed , we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it .
i did n't do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .	i guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .
i guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .	i guess not .
i guess not .	i think i 'll have to go out and burn them off .
i think i 'll have to go out and burn them off .	roger .
i 'm sorry , frank , but i do n't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .	he 's got a point .
sorry to interrupt the <unk> , dave , but i think we 've got a problem .	what is it , hal ?
what is it , hal ?	my <unk> . shows an <unk> failure of the antenna <unk> unit .
the unit is still operational , dave . but it will fail within seventy-two hours .	i understand hal . we 'll take care of it . please , let me have the hard copy .
not now , hal , i 'd like to talk to you about something .	sure , dave , what 's up ?
sure , dave , what 's up ?	you know that we checked the two <unk> that you reported in <unk> failure condition ?
you know that we checked the two <unk> that you reported in <unk> failure condition ?	yes , i know .
yes , i know .	you probably also know that we found them okay .
you probably also know that we found them okay .	yes , i know that . but i can assure you that they were about to fail .
i 'm not questioning your word , dave , but it 's just not possible . i 'm not capable of being wrong .	hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?	look , dave , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the <unk> , and with your test gear .
look , dave , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the <unk> , and with your test gear .	okay , hal , well let 's see the way things go from here on .
naturally , dave , i 'm not pleased that the <unk> has failed , but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and <unk> . i certainly would n't want to be disconnected , even temporarily , as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history .	i 'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .
i 'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .	well , do n't worry about it .
well , do n't worry about it .	and do n't you worry about it .
and do n't you worry about it .	is your confidence in me fully restored ?
is your confidence in me fully restored ?	yes , it is , hal .
yes , it is , hal .	well , that 's a relief . you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission .
too bad about frank , is n't it ?	yes , it is .
yes , it is .	i suppose you 're pretty broken up about it ?
i suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be <unk> for another three months .	the antenna has to be replaced .
the antenna has to be replaced .	<unk> the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
<unk> the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .	it does n't have to be , hal . it 's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .
it does n't have to be , hal . it 's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .	i do n't really agree with you , dave . my <unk> memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission <unk> .
if you 're determined to <unk> the crew now , i can handle the whole thing myself . there 's no need for you to trouble .	i 'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .
i 'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .	look , dave your 've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .
look , dave your 've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .	hal , switch to manual <unk> control .
hal , switch to manual <unk> control .	i do n't like to <unk> myself , dave , but it would be much better now for you to rest . you 've been involved in a very <unk> situation .
i can tell from the tone of your voice , dave , that you 're upset . why do n't you take a stress pill and get some rest .	hal , i 'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual <unk> control .
hal , i 'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual <unk> control .	i 'm sorry , dave , but in <unk> with <unk> <unk> , quote , when the crew are dead or <unk> , the computer must assume control , <unk> . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to <unk> <unk> exercise it .
i 'm sorry , dave , but in <unk> with <unk> <unk> , quote , when the crew are dead or <unk> , the computer must assume control , <unk> . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to <unk> <unk> exercise it .	hal , unless you follow my instructions , i shall be forced to disconnect you .
i am prepared to do that anyway .	i know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and <unk> <unk> in the mission .
i know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and <unk> <unk> in the mission .	listen to me very carefully , hal . unless you immediately release the <unk> control and follow every order i give from this point on , i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete <unk> .
continued	yes , i remember you mentioning it . i got mine about the same time .
continued	did they have any explanation for this ?
continued	well , what is it ?
<unk>	well ... it 's silly , but ... if you want to , why do n't you ?
continued	still , you really do n't believe it , do you ?
continued	well , the only important <unk> of the mission are : where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming back , and ... why are we going ?
i 'm at space station five , darling . how are you ?	i 'm fine , daddy . when are you coming home ?

thank you .	well , how 's it going back there ?
well , i 've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .	i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .	berkeley told me that they think it came from <unk> on a returning mars flight .
berkeley told me that they think it came from <unk> on a returning mars flight .	yes , well , whatever it is , they 're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
yes , well , whatever it is , they 're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .	i was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .

how is gregor ?	he 's fine . but i 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .
he 's fine . but i 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .	well , where are all of you off to ?
<unk> control came on the air just long enough to transmit their <unk> .	well , that does sound very odd .
are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink ?	no , thank you ... and i 'm afraid now i really must be going .
no , thank you ... and i 'm afraid now i really must be going .	well , i hope that you and your wife can come to the <unk> . conference in june .

how do you do , mr. miller ?	i 'm terribly sorry . i was just on my way down to meet you . i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time , and i was on my way out of the office when , suddenly , the phone rang .

yes , i think so . just about then .	i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were <unk> .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were <unk> .	yes , it 's coming along very well .
oh , i really do n't have time for a drink . if it 's all right i 'll just sit for a minute and then i 've got to be off .	are you quite sure ?
are you quite sure ?	yes , really , thank you very much .
well , as it happens , i 'm on my way up to the moon	are you , by any chance , going up to your base at <unk> ?
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at <unk> ?	yes , as a matter of fact , i am .
i 'm sorry , but i 'm not sure i know what you mean .	well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at <unk> .
well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at <unk> .	really ?
really ?	yes . well , for one thing , whenever you phone the base , all you can get is a recording which <unk> that the phone lines are temporarily out of order .
yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it 's been going on for the past ten days .	you mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
you mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?	that 's right .
that 's right .	i see .
yes , and i 'm <unk> there 's going to be a bit of a row about it . denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the <unk> . convention .	yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely .
yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely .	fortunately , they did .
fortunately , they did .	well , i 'm glad about that .
dr. floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem <unk> to discuss , may i ask you a <unk> question ?	certainly .
certainly .	quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at <unk> . something , <unk> , of an unknown origin . is this , in fact , what has happened ?
this epidemic could easily spread to our base , dr. floyd . we should be given all the facts .	dr. <unk> ... i 'm not permitted to discuss this .
dr. floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under <unk> ?	i 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under <unk> as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security <unk> are to be <unk> in writing from <unk> one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be <unk> time for a full study to be made of the situation before any <unk> <unk> can be given to making a public announcement .
yes , it does . the <unk> structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .	how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?	by the <unk> between the mother rock and the fill .
by the <unk> between the mother rock and the fill .	any clue as to what it is ?
any clue as to what it is ?	not really . it 's completely <unk> . no sound or energy sources have been <unk> . the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it . a laser drill
but you do n't have any idea as to what it is ?	tomb , shine , <unk> spare part , take your choice .
any ideas about the <unk> ?	well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something <unk> , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a <unk> <unk> device ?
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something <unk> , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a <unk> <unk> device ?	has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?	i do n't think it has , but i 'd like to check that . simpson , what 's the log on that ?
oh , <unk> . it 's the first real sleep i 've had for the past two days .	there 's nothing like <unk> sleep for a complete rest .
there 's nothing like <unk> sleep for a complete rest .	when do we arrive at <unk> ?
when do we arrive at <unk> ?	we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?	oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i 'm just fine .
thank you .	incidentally , dr. floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
incidentally , dr. floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?	what do you mean ?
what do you mean ?	well ... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at <unk> . we have to stay inside for the time it take to <unk> - about twenty-four hours . and then we 're going to back empty .
well ... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at <unk> . we have to stay inside for the time it take to <unk> - about twenty-four hours . and then we 're going to back empty .	i see .
i see .	i take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at <unk> ?
well , i 'll tell you why i ask . you see , i 've got a girl who works in the <unk> department of the <unk> <unk> and i have n't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so , and with all these stories one hears , i 'm a little concerned about her .	i see . well , i 'm sorry about that . i would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .
i see . well , i 'm sorry about that . i would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .	yes , well , i would n't have been too concerned about it , except i 've heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , i 've heard that ten people have died already .
well , fine . thanks very much , anyway , and i hope you do n't mind me asking ?	no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .
no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .	well , thank you very much , and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable .
