permanently <unk> ? are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has n't this <unk> ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?	look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?
look , i 'm in here . you call this a career move ?	and is n't there a movie in the works about you ?
and is n't there a movie in the works about you ?	we 're in negotiations , that 's correct .
we 're in negotiations , that 's correct .	but does n't the son of sam law prevent criminals from <unk> from their crimes ?
but does n't the son of sam law prevent criminals from <unk> from their crimes ?	that does n't apply to me because i 'm not a criminal . i 'm not a criminal ! i was n't convicted .
space <unk> 5 - lounge	well , how nice to see you again , elena . you 're looking wonderful .
continued	i 'm afraid i 've only got a few minutes , but i 'd love to .
continued	she 's wonderful .
continued	well , i suppose they 've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment .
continued	how did they manage to do that without any communication ?
continued	i 'm sorry , dr. <unk> , but i 'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
continued	we 're trying to get there . i hope we can .
hi . frank ... coming in , please .	right . just a sec .
right . just a sec .	okay .
okay .	okay , come on down .
dave , if you 've a minute , i 'd like your advice on something .	sure , what is it ?
sure , what is it ?	well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying .
well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying .	what 's up ?
what 's up ?	it 's about my salary <unk> .
it 's about my salary <unk> .	yes ?
yes ?	well i got the papers on my official <unk> to <unk> two weeks before we left .
that 's right . well , naturally , i did n't say anything to payroll . i assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . but it 's been almost three weeks now and i 'm still being paid as an <unk> .	interesting that you mention it , because i 've got the same problem .
interesting that you mention it , because i 've got the same problem .	really .
really .	yes .
yes .	yesterday , i finally called the accounting office at mission control , and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the <unk> <unk> for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either .
not really . they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall , and that we 're being charged against <unk> <unk> accounting offices .	it 's possible .
it 's possible .	well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?	i do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .
i do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . i 'm sure they 'll straighten it out .	i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .	no . i never did , either .
i suppose the idea was <unk> training .	i suppose so . though , of course , there 's a more <unk> explanation .
i suppose so . though , of course , there 's a more <unk> explanation .	oh ?
oh ?	yes . you must have heard the <unk> that went around during <unk> <unk> .
yes . you must have heard the <unk> that went around during <unk> <unk> .	no , as a matter of fact , i did n't .
no , as a matter of fact , i did n't .	oh , well , apparently there 's something about the mission that the sleeping <unk> know that we do n't know , and that 's why we were trained <unk> and that 's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard .
i do n't know . all i heard is that there 's something about the mission we were n't told .	that seems very unlikely .
that seems very unlikely .	yes , i thought so .
yes , i thought so .	of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .	how ?
how ?	just ask hal . it 's <unk> they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from hal .
just ask hal . it 's <unk> they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from hal .	that 's true .
not really . though , it is strange when you think about it . it did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training .	yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .
yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us .	i know . it would be almost <unk> .
i know . it would be almost <unk> .	but not completely <unk> ?
but not completely <unk> ?	i suppose it is n't <unk> impossible .
i suppose it is n't <unk> impossible .	i guess it is n't .
i guess it is n't .	still , all we have to do is ask hal .
well , that 's something .	yes , i do n't know what to make of it .
yes , i do n't know what to make of it .	i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .	yes , but it 's more likely that the <unk> on our testing gear are too low .
yes , but it 's more likely that the <unk> on our testing gear are too low .	anyway , it 's just as well that we replace it . better safe than sorry .
good morning . how 's it going ?	are you reasonably awake ?
are you reasonably awake ?	oh , i 'm fine , i 'm wide awake . what 's up ?
oh , i 'm fine , i 'm wide awake . what 's up ?	well ... hal 's reported the <unk> about to fail again .
well ... hal 's reported the <unk> about to fail again .	you 're kidding .
you 're kidding .	no .
i do n't know . hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure .	two units in four days . how many <unk> do we have ?
two units in four days . how many <unk> do we have ?	two more .
two more .	well , i hope there 's nothing wrong with the assembly on those . <unk> wise we 're out of business .
hal ?	yes .
it 's the last one .	well , now that we 've got one that 's actually failed , we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it .
i did n't do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .	i guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .
i guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy .	i guess not .
i guess not .	i think i 'll have to go out and burn them off .
i think i 'll have to go out and burn them off .	roger .
i 'm sorry , frank , but i do n't think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .	he 's got a point .
sorry to interrupt the <unk> , dave , but i think we 've got a problem .	what is it , hal ?
what is it , hal ?	my <unk> . shows an <unk> failure of the antenna <unk> unit .
the unit is still operational , dave . but it will fail within seventy-two hours .	i understand hal . we 'll take care of it . please , let me have the hard copy .
not now , hal , i 'd like to talk to you about something .	sure , dave , what 's up ?
sure , dave , what 's up ?	you know that we checked the two <unk> that you reported in <unk> failure condition ?
you know that we checked the two <unk> that you reported in <unk> failure condition ?	yes , i know .
yes , i know .	you probably also know that we found them okay .
you probably also know that we found them okay .	yes , i know that . but i can assure you that they were about to fail .
i 'm not questioning your word , dave , but it 's just not possible . i 'm not capable of being wrong .	hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?	look , dave , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the <unk> , and with your test gear .
look , dave , i know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the <unk> , and with your test gear .	okay , hal , well let 's see the way things go from here on .
naturally , dave , i 'm not pleased that the <unk> has failed , but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and <unk> . i certainly would n't want to be disconnected , even temporarily , as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history .	i 'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .
i 'm sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .	well , do n't worry about it .
well , do n't worry about it .	and do n't you worry about it .
and do n't you worry about it .	is your confidence in me fully restored ?
is your confidence in me fully restored ?	yes , it is , hal .
yes , it is , hal .	well , that 's a relief . you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission .
too bad about frank , is n't it ?	yes , it is .
yes , it is .	i suppose you 're pretty broken up about it ?
i suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be <unk> for another three months .	the antenna has to be replaced .
the antenna has to be replaced .	<unk> the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
<unk> the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .	it does n't have to be , hal . it 's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .
it does n't have to be , hal . it 's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .	i do n't really agree with you , dave . my <unk> memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission <unk> .
if you 're determined to <unk> the crew now , i can handle the whole thing myself . there 's no need for you to trouble .	i 'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .
i 'm goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .	look , dave your 've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .
look , dave your 've probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .	hal , switch to manual <unk> control .
hal , switch to manual <unk> control .	i do n't like to <unk> myself , dave , but it would be much better now for you to rest . you 've been involved in a very <unk> situation .
i can tell from the tone of your voice , dave , that you 're upset . why do n't you take a stress pill and get some rest .	hal , i 'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual <unk> control .
hal , i 'm in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual <unk> control .	i 'm sorry , dave , but in <unk> with <unk> <unk> , quote , when the crew are dead or <unk> , the computer must assume control , <unk> . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to <unk> <unk> exercise it .
i 'm sorry , dave , but in <unk> with <unk> <unk> , quote , when the crew are dead or <unk> , the computer must assume control , <unk> . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to <unk> <unk> exercise it .	hal , unless you follow my instructions , i shall be forced to disconnect you .
i am prepared to do that anyway .	i know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and <unk> <unk> in the mission .
i know that you 've had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and <unk> <unk> in the mission .	listen to me very carefully , hal . unless you immediately release the <unk> control and follow every order i give from this point on , i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete <unk> .
continued	yes , i remember you mentioning it . i got mine about the same time .
continued	did they have any explanation for this ?
continued	well , what is it ?
<unk>	well ... it 's silly , but ... if you want to , why do n't you ?
continued	still , you really do n't believe it , do you ?
continued	well , the only important <unk> of the mission are : where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming back , and ... why are we going ?
i 'm at space station five , darling . how are you ?	i 'm fine , daddy . when are you coming home ?

thank you .	well , how 's it going back there ?
well , i 've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .	i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .	berkeley told me that they think it came from <unk> on a returning mars flight .
berkeley told me that they think it came from <unk> on a returning mars flight .	yes , well , whatever it is , they 're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
yes , well , whatever it is , they 're certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .	i was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .

how is gregor ?	he 's fine . but i 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .
he 's fine . but i 'm afraid we do n't get a chance to see each other very much these days .	well , where are all of you off to ?
<unk> control came on the air just long enough to transmit their <unk> .	well , that does sound very odd .
are you sure you wo n't change your mind about a drink ?	no , thank you ... and i 'm afraid now i really must be going .
no , thank you ... and i 'm afraid now i really must be going .	well , i hope that you and your wife can come to the <unk> . conference in june .

how do you do , mr. miller ?	i 'm terribly sorry . i was just on my way down to meet you . i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time , and i was on my way out of the office when , suddenly , the phone rang .

yes , i think so . just about then .	i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were <unk> .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were <unk> .	yes , it 's coming along very well .
oh , i really do n't have time for a drink . if it 's all right i 'll just sit for a minute and then i 've got to be off .	are you quite sure ?
are you quite sure ?	yes , really , thank you very much .
well , as it happens , i 'm on my way up to the moon	are you , by any chance , going up to your base at <unk> ?
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at <unk> ?	yes , as a matter of fact , i am .
i 'm sorry , but i 'm not sure i know what you mean .	well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at <unk> .
well , it 's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at <unk> .	really ?
really ?	yes . well , for one thing , whenever you phone the base , all you can get is a recording which <unk> that the phone lines are temporarily out of order .
yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it 's been going on for the past ten days .	you mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
you mean you have n't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?	that 's right .
that 's right .	i see .
yes , and i 'm <unk> there 's going to be a bit of a row about it . denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the <unk> . convention .	yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely .
yes ... well , i hope the crew got back safely .	fortunately , they did .
fortunately , they did .	well , i 'm glad about that .
dr. floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem <unk> to discuss , may i ask you a <unk> question ?	certainly .
certainly .	quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at <unk> . something , <unk> , of an unknown origin . is this , in fact , what has happened ?
this epidemic could easily spread to our base , dr. floyd . we should be given all the facts .	dr. <unk> ... i 'm not permitted to discuss this .
dr. floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under <unk> ?	i 'm afraid it can and it will be kept under <unk> as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security <unk> are to be <unk> in writing from <unk> one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be <unk> time for a full study to be made of the situation before any <unk> <unk> can be given to making a public announcement .
yes , it does . the <unk> structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .	how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?	by the <unk> between the mother rock and the fill .
by the <unk> between the mother rock and the fill .	any clue as to what it is ?
any clue as to what it is ?	not really . it 's completely <unk> . no sound or energy sources have been <unk> . the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we 've been barely able to scratch it . a laser drill
but you do n't have any idea as to what it is ?	tomb , shine , <unk> spare part , take your choice .
any ideas about the <unk> ?	well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something <unk> , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a <unk> <unk> device ?
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something <unk> , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a <unk> <unk> device ?	has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?	i do n't think it has , but i 'd like to check that . simpson , what 's the log on that ?
oh , <unk> . it 's the first real sleep i 've had for the past two days .	there 's nothing like <unk> sleep for a complete rest .
there 's nothing like <unk> sleep for a complete rest .	when do we arrive at <unk> ?
when do we arrive at <unk> ?	we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
we 're scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?	oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i 'm just fine .
thank you .	incidentally , dr. floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
incidentally , dr. floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?	what do you mean ?
what do you mean ?	well ... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at <unk> . we have to stay inside for the time it take to <unk> - about twenty-four hours . and then we 're going to back empty .
well ... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at <unk> . we have to stay inside for the time it take to <unk> - about twenty-four hours . and then we 're going to back empty .	i see .
i see .	i take it this is something to do with the trouble they 're having up at <unk> ?
well , i 'll tell you why i ask . you see , i 've got a girl who works in the <unk> department of the <unk> <unk> and i have n't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so , and with all these stories one hears , i 'm a little concerned about her .	i see . well , i 'm sorry about that . i would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .
i see . well , i 'm sorry about that . i would n't think there 's any cause for alarm .	yes , well , i would n't have been too concerned about it , except i 've heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , i 've heard that ten people have died already .
well , fine . thanks very much , anyway , and i hope you do n't mind me asking ?	no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .
no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .	well , thank you very much , and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable .

they hired you . you 're like , a private detective ?	that 's exactly what i am .

hey , what 's wrong with you -- let 's see a smile .	had kind of a long night .
had kind of a long night .	dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .
dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .	no , the dan part was nice ...
good to see you again , mr. grey . i 've got to go find dan .	yeah , before they <unk> his <unk> .
it was no accident . it was krueger . he used to get in through my dreams , but not anymore . he 's found some other way .	alice , it 's no dream . i 'm sorry ... dan 's dead .
have you visited the little boy on my floor ? jacob , the one who looks kind of sad ?	there are n't any little boys on your floor .
there are n't any little boys on your floor .	he must 've wandered up from the children 's ward . i just wondered what was wrong with him .
did everyone call everyone ?	they 're waiting for us ... but let 's keep this dream stuff between you and me .
what 's that got to do with it ?	when dan died you were n't even asleep . you said so . end of story .
it was just an accident . like with dan .	no accident . i tried to warn all of you about krueger .
i do n't understand what 's happening . krueger has to use my dreams , but he got to dan and <unk> while i was awake . how 's he doing it ?	why do n't you two stick to reality .
you had me scared on the phone . what 's wrong with the baby ?	i think krueger 's trying to do something to it .
oh , alice ... no . honey , i love you but you 're going to have to get a hold of yourself ...	mark knows i 'm not crazy . ask him to show you his hands .
i really think you need to calm down now , okay ?	i just ca n't figure out how he 's getting in when i 'm awake ...
i am your friend , and i 'm worried sick about you . but , you 're like a locked safe . you 've got ta start dealing with reality .	krueger is reality .
krueger is reality .	and so is your baby . you 've got more than just yourself to think of now !
and so is your baby . you 've got more than just yourself to think of now !	what do you think i 'm doing ? look . whether you believe it or not , krueger is back . he 's after the baby and if i do n't try to do something about it , who will ? ?
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman . why do n't you take off - leave <unk> and cool out somewhere for a while ?	goddamn it , <unk> ! you do n't just run away from this guy ! he finds you in your dreams .
look ... we 're all tired . none of us had any sleep since friday night ...	that 's the only reason you 're alive ...
are you alright ?	yeah ... so that 's him . and you 're not crazy .
you think that 's the place she 's buried ?	if they actually bothered to bury her .
what ?	jacob . we 've got to get to amanda before it 's too late .
but how are we gon na --	we 've got to go to the asylum and find her body . mark said her soul 's trapped with it -- that 's why she ca n't come to me . it must be !
you do good work , alice .	so did dan .
he sure loves to stay awake .	that 's okay . he 's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep .
give up , mark , it 's hopeless .	i think i 'm starting to wear her down . have some anyway .
not to mention the <unk> of <unk> .	<unk> , come on . one burger with me ?
my dad 's got this thing about drinking in the house .	well we got ta do something !
i 've got to write some of this down .	that 's why it 's my fault dan 's dead .
mark , are you okay ?	yeah . i 'm just aces .
i want to talk to both you guys about <unk> . and ...	i 'm very fucking sorry , but <unk> is dead today . could we interest you in someone else ?
i thought about that .	she must 've fallen asleep at the table ...
then get out !	mark !
do you think i 'm an idiot ... for being in love with her ?	nobody thinks that .
maybe it was her mother who killed her , with all that <unk> perfect shit .	it was n't her mother . the only reason we 're still here is that none of us has slept since the <unk> party .
tell me some more about this krueger guy .	why do n't i go make some coffee . there 's a lot to tell .
who 's jacob ?	my baby !
my baby !	what , you named it already ?
whoa , slow down . how 're you gon na hide from a guy like that , leave the planet ?	i do n't know !
where are you going ?	i 'm going to see what else i can find out about mr. fred krueger
i could n't do that , mark . he 's my last link with dan ... no , i want him .	then we 'll find another way .
they think i 'm nuts .	that 's their problem .
no , it 's our problem , mark . if i do n't deal with this , they really might try to take jacob . you said she committed suicide ?	that 's what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger 's trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .
that 's what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger 's trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .	meaning ?
they could n't prove it . no body ! nuns <unk> themselves off is bad for business .	but i 've seen her grave .
but i 've seen her grave .	empty plot . memorial stone . vacant . they never did put her under . cool , huh ?
poor woman ...	no shit .
i do n't understand .	she killed herself . her soul 's gon na be in <unk> .
yeah , when are you gon na come to your senses ?	next life . oh , what 's that ?
next life . oh , what 's that ?	my <unk> love . have some .
meet me later . <unk> . cherry pie . banana <unk> . and no mom !	<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ... and no <unk> career .
that club sucks , they card everybody . let 's just party at your place .	you know my mother -- get real . what about alice 's ?
he 's right . sometimes i feel like i 'm living with <unk> .	who ?
who ?	oh , he was this ancient guy i read about who like , killed his kids 'cause they did n't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should .
oh man ! i could 've gone all night without looking at that .	i do n't believe this ... all that <unk> you paint in the <unk> and you 're <unk> ?
these things are wild ... what do you think ?	makes you look like a nun --
all right kids , i tell you what we 're gon na do . i 've got swimming practice until <unk> today ...	yeah ...
yeah ...	that means they 're gon na give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i 'm done .
have another one , sounds like you need it .	<unk> , i 'm done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . are n't you going in ?
<unk> , i 'm done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . are n't you going in ?	nah . it 's getting too cold for me , and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair . she 's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night .
stop saying that , it 's bullshit .	i want to talk about the baby .
look . dan 's parents were pushing him . pushing him hard . he was bitching about it at the party last night . he was under pressure . we all are .	pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy .
bottom line , alice . anybody , supernatural or not , that wants to hurt you - he 'll have to go through us first .	all of us . right ?
dan . and he 's taking alice with him -- pretty good dive <unk> . you 've been practicing .	two hours a day , six days a week .
vomit ?	faint .
why do n't you shut up and let her talk ! two of us died in the last two days , does that strike you as particularly normal ? !	mark ...
mark ...	i 'm not finished - i loved <unk> . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i 'd like to hear about it !
i 'm not finished - i loved <unk> . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i 'd like to hear about it !	i ca n't listen to this .
it 's okay .	stick around , please ?
you , too ?	he invited me to his house last night .
i should have <unk> , when i heard that <unk> . ' i thought it was your father .	it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .
it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .	how is he - ?
how is he - ?	it was <unk> . he 'll be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .
it was <unk> . he 'll be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .	and they thought < u > you < /u > could re- place the skipper ?
you could train someone else .	not in two days . look : do you think i < u > wanted < /u > to come ? if it did n't mean so much to dad - proving his <unk> - it 's the last thing i 'd want !
what is it ?	your <unk> . ' this came for you .
your <unk> . ' this came for you .	my father ! he 's not - ?
my father ! he 's not - ?	dead ? matter of fact , he 's much better . he 's left the hospital .
what did you mean : i 'm <unk> ? '	your father can be in <unk> , alaska , tomorrow . we have two choices : ask them to send him out in a <unk> ' , and take you off , or the shark can put back into <unk> ...
you <unk> school boys ' are all alike , are n't you ? anybody who does n't happen to think like a little <unk> puppet is , <unk> <unk> , a coward !	< u > you < /u > said it . but i wo n't argue -
wearing a uniform does n't <unk> an automatic <unk> on courage , < u > commander < /u > ! it just so happens i 'm < u > not < /u > a coward - physical or mental - and before i 'd risk my father 's life ...	we 're < u > all < /u > risking our lives !
we 're < u > all < /u > risking our lives !	that may be . but dad stays where < u > he < /u > is , and i 'm staying here !
that may be . but dad stays where < u > he < /u > is , and i 'm staying here !	you 're really a <unk> <unk> , are n't you ?
you 're really a <unk> <unk> , are n't you ?	perhaps . but the idea of <unk> going to < u > school < /u > to spend my < u > life < /u > at a <unk> <unk> that should have disappeared with the <unk> - i 'm referring to war - < u > that < /u > strikes me as the < u > worst < /u > <unk> of all - being <unk> yellow !
perhaps . but the idea of <unk> going to < u > school < /u > to spend my < u > life < /u > at a <unk> <unk> that should have disappeared with the <unk> - i 'm referring to war - < u > that < /u > strikes me as the < u > worst < /u > <unk> of all - being <unk> yellow !	you mean < u > nothing < /u > is worth fighting for ?
you mean < u > nothing < /u > is worth fighting for ?	peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win < u > those < /u > by fighting wars , and < u > i 'll < /u > show you an idiot !
peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win < u > those < /u > by fighting wars , and < u > i 'll < /u > show you an idiot !	you may not < u > win < /u > them . but without men like your father , to <unk> ' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they 'd have disappeared , < u > long < /u > ago !
unidentified flying objects .	then ... this is a <unk> <unk> ? '
that 's enough , <unk> . i 've told you before , wearing boards on your shoulders , and <unk> with a stiff spine does n't <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk> bone - !	- any more than being the son of captain <unk> does !
however our ideas disagree , as i 've said before , i 'm < u > not < /u > a coward ! and it happens you 've got no choice : either < u > i < /u > take you down there , in the <unk> , or you do n't get there -	i 'd sooner swim !
they 're so remote - cold - beautiful , the stars . but now - i wonder -	yes ?
yes ?	which is the one - we have to worry about ?
maybe - just <unk> ' - when their ship does n't return - they 'll decide not to come here , after all .	but if they < u > do < /u > ?
but if they < u > do < /u > ?	i do n't know .
i do n't know .	i would n't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father -
i would n't worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark - and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father -	and his <unk> ' son ! we 'll give 'em a < u > rough < /u > < u > reception < /u > , wo n't we ?
now , dave old buddy , you know you 're exaggerating - what do you think of this husband of yours ? on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the <unk> and his <unk> and firing officer . but unfortunately , in the case of lieutenant dave <unk> of the tiger shark and myself -	but julie 's a nice girl , and i 've seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !
but julie 's a nice girl , and i 've seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !	helen . i appeal to you -
reef !	so they caught up with you , too ?
so they caught up with you , too ?	at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is <unk> 's birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now -
at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is <unk> 's birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now -	< u > that 's < /u > the worst possible moment ?
< u > that 's < /u > the worst possible moment ?	what could be worse than <unk> ing a little girl ?
what could be worse than <unk> ing a little girl ?	disappointing a < u > big < /u > girl !
you 've asked why i stay a bachelor ? there goes the best reason i know !	huh ?
huh ?	i might have a son like < u > that ! < /u >
i guess skipper <unk> re- tired before you <unk> at the academy , did n't he ?	i guess .
i guess .	one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero - in the best sense of the word - in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .
one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero - in the best sense of the word - in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .	so ?

but < u > they 're < /u > not skipper <unk> 's son ! it broke his heart . then when some newspapers called carl 'the honest , sincere son of a <unk> father ' - captain <unk> resigned from the navy . oh , he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the <unk> ' - but it broke him , all the same .	have you ever talked to carl - tried to see his side ?
have you ever talked to carl - tried to see his side ?	<unk> ' side ? i 've seen it , all right . a nice , bright yellow !

we 're stuck tight !	skipper ! look at the depth gauge !
you 've got to let us try , skipper --	<unk> ? '

you all wait here . i 'm going inside , take a look .	not < u > alone < /u > , you 're not !
how about that ! the bow drove half through her , but she sealed herself right up .	what 's more important - there 's our problem . the bow ram - the <unk> are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !
what 's more important - there 's our problem . the bow ram - the <unk> are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !	i think you 're right .
i think you 're right .	go back and tell dr. <unk> . have him report to the skipper .
yeah ?	listen ! hear that ?
i do n't hear anything . maybe you 've been down here too long . why do n't you go back up and -	strange you did n't hear it . <unk> <unk>

is there any way out of it ?	seems to be all around ...
seems to be all around ...	what about down ?
what about down ?	i ... do n't know !
course and speed ?	speed ... about twenty-two knots . course ... due north !
a mass of <unk> stuff came out of the thing , and caught our torpedo !	what ? ? ?

now they feel it ... down below .	radiation level ... constantly rising ...
excuse me , captain - there may be one last , desperate chance - a <unk> shot ...	anything -- -
anything -- -	it 's possible i could <unk> one of the torpedo guidance systems to the <unk> - so it would <unk> ' on the <unk> when he rises from the pole .
it 's possible i could <unk> one of the torpedo guidance systems to the <unk> - so it would <unk> ' on the <unk> when he rises from the pole .	what about time ... ?

here 's my theory . twombley , <unk> of illegal union loans or whatever , starts <unk> around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son-in-law is involved .	so mel gordon would n't want a professional hit . that 'd make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .

we got ta figure on them getting into the complex .	that 's right . so we put up <unk> <unk> at these <unk> ... ... and seal these <unk> here and here . then they can only come at us from these two <unk> and we create a free field of fire for the other two <unk> units , here .
they 're in the approach corridor .	on my way .
now many ?	ca n't tell . lots . d gun 's down to twenty . ten . it 's out .
newt time then can walk right up and knock .	but they do n't know that . they 're probably looking for other ways to get in . that 'll take them awhile .

what do you mean , sire ?	well , i mean occasionally it seems to have , how shall one say ? how shall one say , director ?
i do n't understand . there are just as many notes , majesty , as are required . neither more nor less .	my dear fellow , there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening . i think i 'm right in saying that , are n't i , court composer ?
my dear , young man , do n't take it too hard . your work is <unk> . it 's quality work . and there are simply too many notes , that 's all . cut a few and it will be perfect .	which few did you have in mind , majesty ?

majesty , may i ask you to do me the greatest favour ?	what is it ?
what is it ?	may i introduce my father ? he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to <unk> . he would so much like to kiss your hand . it would make his whole stay so <unk> for him .

it is not your place to ask questions . is it true ?	well , yes , i admit it is .
well , yes , i admit it is .	would you tell me why ?
would you tell me why ?	well , majesty , it is only a comedy .
mozart , i am a <unk> man . i do not <unk> things <unk> . when i do , i have good reason . <unk> is a bad play . it <unk> up hatred between the classes . in france it has caused nothing but <unk> . my own dear sister <unk> writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people . i do not wish to see the same fears starting here .	sire , i swear to your majesty , there 's nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .
sire , i swear to your majesty , there 's nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .	i think you are rather innocent , my friend . in these dangerous times i can not afford to <unk> our <unk> or our people simply over a theatre piece .
but , majesty , this is just a <unk> . it 's a piece about love .	ah , love again .
ah , love again .	but it 's new , it 's entirely new . it 's so new , people will go mad for it . for example , i have a scene in the second act - it starts as a <unk> , just a man and wife <unk> . suddenly the wife 's <unk> little maid comes in <unk> - a very funny situation . <unk> turns into <unk> . then the husband 's equally screaming valet comes in . <unk> turns into quartet . then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes <unk> , and so on . on and on , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ! how long do you think i can sustain that ?

forgive me , majesty . i 'm a vulgar man . but i assure you , my music is not .	you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .
you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .	sire , the whole opera is finished . do you know how much work went into it ?
<unk> . well then , we should make some effort to acquire him . we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?	i agree , majesty , but i 'm afraid it 's not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the <unk> .
i agree , majesty , but i 'm afraid it 's not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the <unk> .	very small pay , i imagine . i 'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer . say , an opera in german for our national theatre .
<unk> . what do you say , <unk> ?	in my opinion , it is time we had a piece in our own language , sir . plain german . for plain people .
yes , sir .	well . there it is .
well , what do you have for me today ?	your majesty , herr mozart -

i do n't think it was really decided , director .	oh , german ! german ! please let it be german .
my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point . do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ?	why not ? it 's charming . i mean , i do n't actually show <unk> <unk> their ! their ! it 's not <unk> ! it 's highly moral , majesty . it 's full of proper german <unk> . i swear it . absolutely !
well done , mozart . really quite fine .	baron !
mozart -	sire , only opera can do this . in a play , if more than one person speaks at the same time , it 's just noise . no one can understand a word . but with music , with music you can have twenty <unk> all talking at once , and it 's not noise - it 's a perfect harmony . is n't that marvelous ?

it was <unk> . what was god up to ? here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god 's gift and there was mozart <unk> his in all directions - even though engaged to be married ! - and no <unk> at all ! was it possible i was being tested ? was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense , no matter how painful ? that was very possible . all the same , why him ? why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility ? my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man . for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts . i could n't stop them .	did you try ?
did you try ?	every day . sometimes for hours i would pray !
yes , father . yes ! so much for my vow of <unk> . what did it matter ? good , patient , <unk> , <unk> - what did it matter ? had goodness made me a good composer ? i realized it absolutely then - that moment : goodness is nothing in the <unk> of art . and i was nothing to god .	you can not say that !

oh my son , my poor son !	do n't pity me . pity yourself . you serve a wicked god . he killed mozart , not i . took him , <unk> him away , without pity . he destroyed his beloved rather than let a <unk> like me get the <unk> share in his glory . he does n't care . understand that . god cares nothing for the man he <unk> and nothing either for the man he uses . he broke mozart in half when he 'd finished with him , and threw him away . like an old , worn out <unk> .

when you get to a certain age , you start wondering . about your legacy . i doubt you even remember outpost <unk> --	i do !
i do !	yeah ? i wan na feel like i did when i wrote that . but i 'm 42 , that 's 100 in <unk> . i look at you and see the things that got me here . but somehow got away .
no ! just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself .	okay . i 'm gary .

... do i ?	somebody said i 'm just another <unk> . with <unk> .
somebody said i 'm just another <unk> . with <unk> .	that 's insane . you 're ahead of your time .
that 's insane . you 're ahead of your time .	that 's what i told her . my wife .
could work with a new switch . there may be a few more things hidden .	do n't spend too much time searching . you ever <unk> somebody 's old code before ? it 's a different skill . stay close to the surface . the <unk> secrets are in plain sight . you know the best place to hide a leaf , right ? in a tree .
how 's it going ?	maybe i 'm going too fast .
maybe i 'm going too fast .	too fast ? at least four companies 're on the verge of <unk> <unk> systems , milo , they --
it 's okay . really .	take a look at this . slightly different approach .
you did this -- overnight ?	you 're making me young again .
milo . what 's up ?	well -- you sent for me .
well -- you sent for me .	right ... right .
you really wrote this just today ?	what 're you implying .
what 're you implying .	nothing !
everything i do is under <unk> . the questions they ask , trying to make anything <unk> look sordid . i 'm confused . does n't everybody in business try to get ahead ?	i 'm sure .
i 'm sure .	the purpose of this company is n't to destroy our <unk> any more than the purpose of living is to breath . but the software business is <unk> : you 're a zero or a one . being obsessive is n't a crime . it 's a character <unk> .
it scales , do n't you think ?	definitely .
i heard what happened .	were the <unk> for teddy ?
had you talked to him much lately ?	just once . <unk> i was worried we did n't have anything to talk about , since work was <unk> . non- <unk> .

the wrong place ?	the answer 's not in the box . it 's in the band .
gary , hi .	you look a little tired .
you look a little tired .	i 'm okay . it 's going well !

no . i just went deeper into the machine . <unk> being the geek to having to explain . lying would 've been worse .	... worse ?
... worse ?	cause he was a liar . and i hated him . `` get your head out of that machine , wise up to the real world .

i 'm pretty close . but when i wrote the last contact <unk> , it wiped out a piece of the content <unk> . you know what it 's like , writing software .	i do know . you focus on the big problem . but somewhere down the chain , something breaks down . something gets destroyed . at first it 's upsetting . you feel you 've lost control .

but still , you ca n't say cbs would n't love to break something like --	say there 's just one `` mole '' working there , like barton at the <unk> . how do we know he 's not the guy we 've contacted ? or she ? or the guy she works for ?
time ?	<unk> has a 40 per cent stake in gary 's <unk> device . that also takes out <unk> . `` <unk> <unk> outpost in new venture , '' which means <unk> is out . `` disney <unk> outpost , '' <unk> is out . `` outpost and <unk> in new deal , '' fox is out . any of these places could have a mole . or all of 'em . it 's like a a <unk> loop . we can go to some alternative press place that <unk> people read , get them and us killed . but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a <unk> to something gary 's got a finger in !
how close are you ?	what ?
what ?	he 's got 12 satellites up . he 's got dishes on top of 21 . he 's building this -- <unk> for skywire . let 's use it .
we ca n't just assume they 're standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch . i 'd have to write in an <unk> .	a what ?
a what ?	it 's how <unk> services push <unk> they wan na sell you . you do n't ask for 'em , they just appear . <unk> to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house . and then the quality of the broadcast would n't exactly be digital , that 's 12 months away .

do n't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars ? a million dollars is n't that much money these days .	all right then ... ... five million dollars !

the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police , herr <unk> , a relationship which , no doubt , <unk> in the younger gentlemen 's promotion .	your loyalty to me and your service to the <unk> has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us ; if you succeed , depend on it , your reward will be your discharge from the army , and a bounty of 100 <unk> .
your loyalty to me and your service to the <unk> has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us ; if you succeed , depend on it , your reward will be your discharge from the army , and a bounty of 100 <unk> .	what is the service , sir ?
what is the service , sir ?	there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen , who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast , and wears the red <unk> and star of the pope 's order of the <unk> . he is made for good society , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , without <unk> , fond of women , of good food , of high play , <unk> and discreet .
you are a <unk> ; you served in the army , and left on account of weakness in the <unk> . he <unk> a great deal , and wins . do you know the cards well ?	only a very little , as soldiers do .
only a very little , as soldiers do .	i had thought you more expert . you must find out if the chevalier cheats . he sees the english and austrian <unk> <unk> , and the young men of either ministry sup <unk> at his house . find out what they talk of , for how much each plays , especially if any of them play on parole . if you are able to , read his private letters , though about those which go to the post , you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there . but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes , and by what channel or messenger . he sleeps with the keys of his <unk> with a string around his neck -- twenty <unk> , if you get an impression of the keys .
what are the chevalier 's intentions ?	i am not sure . the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money , he would have to fight for it .
has he sent the challenge yet ?	not yet , but i believe he <unk> to .
you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner . when he comes out to his carriage a couple of <unk> will mount the box , and the <unk> will get his orders to move on .	and his baggage ?
and his baggage ?	oh ! that will be sent after him . i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers , you say ; and at noon , after parade , shall be at the inn . you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair , and will wait for me at the chevalier 's rooms until my arrival . we must force that box . you are a <unk> hound , or you would have got the key long ago .
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family .	the man that marries dorothy <unk> must first kill me -- do you mind that ?
dorothy might love me or not , as she likes , but best will have to fight me before he marries her !	faith , i think you are a lad that 's likely to keep your word .
a pretty day 's work of it you have made , master roderick . knowing your uncle to be <unk> for money , and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred <unk> into the family ? best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so . he takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been <unk> herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past , and missing them all , and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father .	and so i am .
and so i am .	and this is the return you make for his kindness ! did n't he harbor you in his house when your father died , and has n't he given you and your mother , <unk> , your fine house of <unk> yonder ?
and this is the return you make for his kindness ! did n't he harbor you in his house when your father died , and has n't he given you and your mother , <unk> , your fine house of <unk> yonder ?	mark this , come what will of it , i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy <unk> . i 'll follow him if it 's into the church , and meet him there . i 'll have his blood , or he shall have mine . will you take my message to him , and arrange the meeting ?
mark this , come what will of it , i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy <unk> . i 'll follow him if it 's into the church , and meet him there . i 'll have his blood , or he shall have mine . will you take my message to him , and arrange the meeting ?	well , if it must be , it must . for a young fellow , you are the most <unk> i ever saw . no officer , bearing his majesty 's commission , can receive a glass of wine on his nose , without <unk> it -- fight you must , and best is a huge , strong fellow .
well , if it must be , it must . for a young fellow , you are the most <unk> i ever saw . no officer , bearing his majesty 's commission , can receive a glass of wine on his nose , without <unk> it -- fight you must , and best is a huge , strong fellow .	he 'll give the better mark . i am not afraid of him .
he 'll give the better mark . i am not afraid of him .	in faith , i believe you are not ; for a lad i never saw more game in my life . give me a kiss , my dear boy . you 're after my own soul . as long as jack <unk> lives , you shall never want a friend or a second .
have you taken my message to him ?	the meeting is arranged . captain best is waiting for you now .

look here , roderick , my boy ; this is silly business . the girl will marry best , mark my words ; and as sure as she does , you 'll forget her . you are but a boy . best is willing to consider you as such . <unk> 's a fine place , and if you have a mind to take a ride <unk> and see the town for a month , here are twenty <unk> at your service . make best an apology , and be off .	a man of honor dies , but never <unk> . i 'll see the captain hanged before i apologize .
<unk> gave me a <unk> of recognition , but offered no public <unk> of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters , and then , shaking hands with me <unk> , gave me news which i wanted , of my family .	i had news of you in <unk> . faith , you 've begun early , like your father 's son , but i think you could not do better than as you have done . but why did you not write home to your poor mother ? she has sent <unk> letters to you in <unk> .

what , with me on the <unk> ? would you kill poor me ?	well , then , i 'll tell you what i 'd do . i 'd jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .
well , then , i 'll tell you what i 'd do . i 'd jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .	jump twenty feet ! you would n't dare to do any such thing on daisy . there 's the captain 's horse , black george , i 've heard say that captain <unk> --
monster ! your father was a tailor , and you are always thinking of the shop . but i 'll have my revenge , i will ! <unk> , will you see me insulted ?	indeed , miss dorothy , i intend to have his blood as sure as my name 's roderick .
i am at your service , mr. cosgrove . how much do you wish to spend ?	as much as possible .
as much as possible .	as much as possible ?
as much as possible ?	yes , for i wish to entertain <unk> .
yes , for i wish to entertain <unk> .	all the same , you must name an amount .
all the same , you must name an amount .	it is entirely up to you . i want the best .
last month , the duke of <unk> spent no more .	all right , five hundred <unk> .
and , to be sure , i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done , and this was the <unk> <unk> and former government minister , lord west , whose acquaintance i made , as i had so many others , at the gaming table .	do you happen to know <unk> <unk> , the <unk> earl of crabs ?
do you happen to know <unk> <unk> , the <unk> earl of crabs ?	by name only .
by name only .	well , sir , this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majesty 's closet , and one with whom our <unk> <unk> is on terms of considerable intimacy . i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief <unk> for the <unk> of your claim to the <unk> which you propose to get .
have you done , mr. cosgrove ?	yes !
yes !	well , mr. cosgrove , i 'll answer you point by point . the king is <unk> <unk> to make <unk> , as you know . your claim , as you call them , have been laid before him , and his majesty 's gracious reply was , that you were the most <unk> man in his <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> , rather than a <unk> . as for <unk> your support from us , you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself <unk> you please . and , now , as i have a great deal of occupation , perhaps you will do me the favor to retire , or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which i can oblige you .
does this assignment interest you ?	yes , minister , i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain <unk> .
was he cheated ?	in so far as i can tell these things -- no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly .
in so far as i can tell these things -- no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly .	<unk> .
a meeting with the prince of <unk> is impossible .	the prince left him only that choice .
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country .	when is he to go ?
then this must be done tomorrow .	what is to be done ?
what has happened , madam , to annoy your ladyship ?	oh , i am grateful to you , sir . i am the wife of captain <unk> <unk> to join him at <unk> . my chair was stopped by a <unk> ; this great <unk> of a <unk> fell down on his knees , armed as he was , and though there were thirty people in the next field , working , when the <unk> attacked , not one of them would help but , on the contrary , wished him `` good luck . ''
be off to your work , you pack of <unk> , or you will have a good taste of my <unk> . have you lost much ?	everything -- my purse , <unk> <unk> of a hundred <unk> , my jewels , my <unk> , watches . and all because this <unk> coward fell to his knees ...
that fool did n't know what was the meaning of a <unk> bill , which was in the <unk> that the fellow took from me .	i am riding to <unk> myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further <unk> .
i am riding to <unk> myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further <unk> .	but i should n't like to put you to such trouble , mister ... ?
but i should n't like to put you to such trouble , mister ... ?	o'higgins ... <unk> o'higgins .
as you have been robbed of your purse , may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might <unk> before reaching your home ?	that 's very kind of you , mr. o'higgins .
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar <unk> at <unk> <unk> . in every sentence , she mentioned a lord or a person of quality . to the lady 's question about my birth and <unk> , i <unk> that i was a young gentleman of large fortune , that i was going to <unk> for my studies , and that my mother allowed me five hundred per <unk> .	you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in <unk> , where <unk> and <unk> of all countries <unk> . i hope you will do me the honor of accepting <unk> in my own house , where captain <unk> will welcome with delight , my gallant young <unk> .
i have good news for you , mr. cosgrove . the firm of <unk> and <unk> , in the city of london , are prepared to lend you <unk> pounds , <unk> against your interest in the <unk> mines . they will redeem the <unk> against the property , which amount to some 10,000 pounds , and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines . they will lend you the <unk> pounds against the lease income , which they will apply to the loan as it comes in , and they will make a charge of 18 % per <unk> interest on the outstanding loan balance .	mr. <unk> , i have made some difficult loans during the past few years , at very <unk> terms , but 18 % a year interest seems very stiff indeed .
mr. <unk> , i have made some difficult loans during the past few years , at very <unk> terms , but 18 % a year interest seems very stiff indeed .	considering your financial circumstances , mr. cosgrove , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better one .
considering your financial circumstances , mr. cosgrove , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better one .	i am prepared to accept the terms , mr. <unk> .
i am prepared to accept the terms , mr. <unk> .	there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature , and provided that <unk> and <unk> can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> in giving her signature .
there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship 's signature , and provided that <unk> and <unk> can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> in giving her signature .	provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> ? are you serious ?
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship 's <unk> ? are you serious ?	may i be quite frank with you ?
may i be quite frank with you ?	yes , of course .
yes , of course .	mister <unk> said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life , and <unk> a <unk> , in which case , she might later <unk> any documents signed by herself while in <unk> , and subject them , at any rate , to a doubtful and expensive <unk> . they were quite <unk> on this point , and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship 's perfect <unk> in the transaction before they would advance a <unk> of their capital .

i see .	when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship 's <unk> , they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth , in their presence , at their <unk> in <unk> lane , london . i requested they come here , and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london , but they <unk> , saying that they did not wish to <unk> the risk of a visit to castle <unk> to negotiate , as they were aware of how other respectable parties , such as <unk> sharp and <unk> had been treated here .

i promise your <unk> a good <unk> if you even so much as go to <unk> 's farm to see him .	yes , papa .
your bother is in america fighting the rebels .	is he all right , papa ?
is he all right , papa ?	yes , he 's fine .
yes , he 's fine .	<unk> was better than you , papa , he used not to swear so , and he taught me many good things while you were away .
i made sir william cosgrove 's acquaintance as usual at the <unk> table . one could not but admire the spirit and <unk> with which he <unk> his favorite <unk> ; for , though worn out with <unk> and a <unk> of diseases , a cripple <unk> about in a chair , and suffering <unk> of agony , yet you would see him every morning , and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth .	hang it , mr. roderick james , you have no more manners than a barber , and i think my black <unk> has been better educated than you ; but you are a young fellow of <unk> and <unk> , and i like you , sir . because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own .
indeed , you are right , sir . look at me . marriage has added forty years to my life . i am dying , a <unk> cripple , at the age of fifty . when i took off lady cosgrove , there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself . fool that i was ! i had enough with my <unk> , perfect freedom , the best society in europe -- and i gave up all these , and married and was miserable . take a warning from me , mr. roderick , and stick to the <unk> . do anything , but marry .	would you have me spend my life all alone ?
would you have me spend my life all alone ?	in truth , sir , yes , but , if you must marry , then marry a <unk> <unk> .
in truth , sir , yes , but , if you must marry , then marry a <unk> <unk> .	the <unk> 's daughter ?
the <unk> 's daughter ?	well , why not a <unk> 's daughter ? no man of sense need <unk> himself or deny himself a single <unk> for his wife 's sake ; on the contrary , if he <unk> the animal properly , he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure , but a comfort in his hours of <unk> . for instance , i have got the <unk> ; who tends me ? a hired valet who <unk> me whenever he has the power . my wife never comes near me . what friend have i ? none in the wide world . men of the world , as you and i are , do n't make friends , and we are fools for our pains .
sir william cosgrove , with his <unk> of <unk> , was dying before us by inches . he was <unk> <unk> up by doctors , and , what with my usual luck , he might be restored to health and live i do n't know how many years . if cosgrove would not die , where was the use of my <unk> his lady ? but my fears were to prove <unk> , for on that very night , patient nature would claim her account .	good evening , mr. james , have you done with my lady ?
good evening , mr. james , have you done with my lady ?	i beg your pardon ?
i beg your pardon ?	come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a <unk> than a fool .
come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a <unk> than a fool .	i think , sir william cosgrove , you have had too much drink . your <unk> , mr. hunt , has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter , of which she is a considerable expert .
gentlemen , see this <unk> youth ! he has been troubled by religious scruples , and has flown for <unk> to my <unk> , mr. hunt , who has asked for advise from my wife , lady cosgrove , and between them both , they are <unk> my <unk> young friend in his faith . did you ever hear of such doctors and such a <unk> ?	faith , sir , if i want to learn good principles , it 's surely better i should apply for them to your lady , and your <unk> than to you ?

well , if my intentions are what you think they are -- if i do wish to step into your shoes , what then ? i have no other intentions than you had yourself . lady cosgrove 's wealth may be great , but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it <unk> ? her rank is <unk> , but not so <unk> as my ambition . i will be sworn to <unk> just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her ; and if i win her , and wear her when you are dead and gone , <unk> , knight , do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will <unk> me ?	is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy one ; my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of <unk> a <unk> ? is n't it a comfort to see her ; like a <unk> <unk> , getting everything ready for her husband 's departure ?
is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy one ; my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of <unk> a <unk> ? is n't it a comfort to see her ; like a <unk> <unk> , getting everything ready for her husband 's departure ?	i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon , knight ?
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon , knight ?	not so soon , my dear , as you may fancy perhaps . why , man , i have been given over many times these four years , and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation . who knows how long i may keep you waiting .
not so soon , my dear , as you may fancy perhaps . why , man , i have been given over many times these four years , and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation . who knows how long i may keep you waiting .	sir , let those laugh that win .
sir , let those laugh that win .	i am sorry for you mr. james . i 'm <unk> to keep you or any gentleman waiting . had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to <unk> my omelette with <unk> ? what are the odds , gentlemen , that i do n't live to see mr. james hang yet ?

they ?	mueller and childs . one of them must 've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper ...
i ... i do n't know ...	what do n't you know ?
what do n't you know ?	this is a lot of information to be getting ... i have to think --
there 's no time to think , ray , we got ta get out of here ! you untie me , we grab the guns , get kendall and nunez , and make a run for it --	no ... no , we can just wait till we get back and then tell the <unk> . 's --
no ... no , we can just wait till we get back and then tell the <unk> . 's --	we wait and i 'm a dead man . i got a black face , a criminal record , and over a hundred other <unk> who 'll testify how much i hated west -- my court martial will take six minutes . it 's either me or them , ray , and you got ta decide right now .
a test will no doubt link you to the killing --	put it down !
you ... i 've seen you around the base . but you ... you 're not army , are you ?	coast guard , special detective detail . we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk .
that 's it . you 're that policeman with friends in low places . tell me , how 's <unk> <unk> doing these days ? those <unk> <unk> must have really been a <unk> --	levi , you got about four hours before armed men show up here , put you on a plane to washington , and lock you in a very small dark room . i suggest you talk to us .
i 've done nothing wrong . i 'm the victim here .	but not the only victim , right ?
but not the only victim , right ?	my , my , my , how did things turn so hostile so quickly ? if i did n't know better , i 'd say you two were out to get me .
my father is a powerful man . over the years he 's used that power to protect me , in one form or another , from certain ... <unk> . i am a homosexual .	senator daddy must be thrilled .
senator daddy must be thrilled .	he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on <unk> occasions to be more discreet about my <unk> , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last four weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ?
he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on <unk> occasions to be more discreet about my <unk> , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last four weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ?	i think you just blew `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' out of the fucking water .
i think you just blew `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' out of the fucking water .	the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled . my father <unk> , so instead , west <unk> me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay .
levi , i do n't know if you 're familiar with <unk> work , but we have this little thing called `` motive '' and you just gave yourself one .	you said you wanted to know what happened -- i 'm telling you the truth .
you said you wanted to know what happened -- i 'm telling you the truth .	what happened to `` degrees '' ?
what happened to `` degrees '' ?	i did n't kill him --
i did n't kill him --	then who did ?
maybe i should n't tell you that . maybe i should tell you i was n't scared at all . but i was ... enough to almost kill him .	but you did n't .
but you did n't .	no . poetic justice , though .
he admitted it .	right in front of us . mueller went after him but we held him back .
why did he come back for you ?	i honestly do n't know . maybe to have someone to cover for him . and i wish i could , but there 's no doubt in my mind he killed those men .
okay . i think that 's it . he rises and walks to the door .	mr. hardy ?
somebody emptied a full clip into him --	stop .
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar --	how many murders did you cover up ? one ? five ? maybe an even ten .
how many murders did you cover up ? one ? five ? maybe an even ten .	can i go to jail for <unk> a guy who 's been shot ?
<unk> attacks are murder on your system . rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer .	my heart <unk> .
is it the truth ?	there 's that word again . as i told you , i was n't in the room when everyone started shooting .
why did you tell us he shot everybody , levi ? you put him in for three murders , the man saved your life --	so i should stay silent about his <unk> ? the guns went off , i ran in , childs shot me , pike and mueller were dead , and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
so i should stay silent about his <unk> ? the guns went off , i ran in , childs shot me , pike and mueller were dead , and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --	dunbar was running out the door ? <unk> ... see that 's where i was confused , because i thought you said nunez was running out the door .
dunbar was running out the door ? <unk> ... see that 's where i was confused , because i thought you said nunez was running out the door .	no . i said dunbar .
no . i said dunbar .	huh . you know , i really thought you said nunez . i thought you said `` dunbar was gone , '' my fault , i got ta check the tape on that . oh , yeah we taped the last interview . this one too . cause it 'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie .
i believe your next line is `` what are you trying to hide ? ''	well ?
well ?	sorry to disappoint . i 'm on <unk> for the injury -- they cloud the mind . you 're right , it was nunez . any more questions ?
dunbar will testify that you were .	then we 'll leave it up to the courts -- his word against mine . what does his father do again ? <unk> ? does n't matter , i 'm sure justice will be served . in any case , my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions , these accusations on his son . he 's quite protective .
something funny , levi ?	i was just thinking of what 's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you .
jail if he 's lucky , the gas chamber if he 's not --	i did n't do anything --
why ?	because of what i saw . who really killed west .
how do you know ?	because i was standing next to him .
or you , levi ? when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him ?	i did n't --
i did n't --	but you ca n't prove it ! you ca n't prove anything until we find the bodies !
you lied to us , levi , you 're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them !	i do n't know --
i do n't know --	where are they !
where are they !	maybe --
maybe --	maybe what --
maybe what --	maybe he ...
how are you ?	been better . i read about what 's been happening with you ... i should have called --
been better . i read about what 's been happening with you ... i should have called --	what kind of trouble are you in ?
that bad ?	would i have called you if it was n't ? if there was any other way --
would i have called you if it was n't ? if there was any other way --	tell me what i can do .
this is warrant officer julia <unk> , the closest thing we have to an <unk> house investigator .	and here you are going out of house . how 's that make you feel , <unk> ?
the official term for it is `` <unk> '' . by the time beth hit us , i 'd canceled all off base <unk> save one -- a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush . we 're missing three and the sergeant . the <unk> are in their eighth week of the cycle , nobody here knows much about them , up to and including their names . but the sergeant ...	it 's not west , is it ? tell me it 's not west .
a few years ago , the army picked our good buddy as their go to <unk> to <unk> out to the press to talk about the <unk> , <unk> military . he even did the standard video <unk> played to all <unk> basic <unk> across the country .	well , he 's a good soldier .
the exercise was one of his section eight `` private sessions '' . left around <unk> yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at <unk> this morning .	and the problem is you only got three .
and the problem is you only got three .	no , the problem is one 's dead , one 's got a bullet in his arm , and one wo n't talk . the one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up .
no , the problem is one 's dead , one 's got a bullet in his arm , and one wo n't talk . the one who wo n't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up .	i 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead one ?
i 'm assuming that 's what made him the dead one ?	cadet <unk> <unk> nunez . killed right in front of me .
which gives us about five hours . why 'd you call me ?	the guy in interrogation said he 'd only talk to a cop .
the guy in interrogation said he 'd only talk to a cop .	and i 'm the closest thing to it , right ?
tom , bottom line : i let those kids go out there . if <unk> shows up and i do n't have any answers for them , my career is finished --	i 'm not gon na let that happen .
he 's not done by a <unk> , i can get more out of him --	he can wait . kendall 's out of surgery .
pike killed west , dunbar killed mueller , childs , and nunez .	who killed pike ?
who killed pike ?	someone must have got a shot off . he was n't exactly a moving target .
we 've already been over the terrain twice . nothing .	there was a hurricane , bill , the wind probably moved it .
there was a hurricane , bill , the wind probably moved it .	<unk> <unk> -- you have to have a body to have a crime .

okay , then let 's <unk> the search to include the <unk> in <unk> stadium and the trunk of my car --	without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .
without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .	from dunbar ? i hate to break this to you , but i do n't think he 's gon na be all that <unk> to put himself in for the death penalty .
from dunbar ? i hate to break this to you , but i do n't think he 's gon na be all that <unk> to put himself in for the death penalty .	nevertheless --
nevertheless --	nevertheless what ' ? kendall will testify and that 'll be enough .
nevertheless what ' ? kendall will testify and that 'll be enough .	not for me .
you mean not enough to save you .	<unk> gets here in three hours . try for the confession .
tom , where are you going --	home , i 'm done .
home , i 'm done .	what about the confession ?
you want a confession ? why do n't you confess , bill : people are dead and you do n't give a shit about it ! only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job , you know this is your fault --	what the hell are you talking about --
what the hell are you talking about --	i 'm talking about west ! we had him , bill , we were there . you 're the fucking base commander , you knew what he did to <unk> and you let him go on the way he always he has --
what i said before --	was dead right . you think dunbar 's on the level ?
was dead right . you think dunbar 's on the level ?	yeah .
yeah .	does <unk> agree ?
it 's over . time of death was <unk> . <unk> 's been notified and i called the senator myself . my report will reflect that his medical condition made this <unk> ... you two had no <unk> in the matter .	that 's horseshit and you know it .
that 's horseshit and you know it .	maybe . but it 's my fault and i 'll carry it .
you think you could explain all this to me ?	i would n't know where to start . i guess it was about one man <unk> another . he thought if the other guy got blamed , people would over look his own wrong <unk> .
they 're taking your command , are n't they ?	the senator ...
i 'm sorry , bill .	do n't be . i 'm not cut out to deal with the west 's of the world .
do n't be . i 'm not cut out to deal with the west 's of the world .	you 're a good soldier , bill .
you 're a good soldier , bill .	i thought you said that was n't a compliment .
it was so good , i actually forgot you 're one of the bigger dogs now . the base commander . the one in control . you could n't let him testify , could you ?	what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?	if you let him testify then it would have all come out . west was supposed to take care of it out there , shut nunez up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal tom hardy , figuring if worse came to worse , he 'd cover for you .
if you let him testify then it would have all come out . west was supposed to take care of it out there , shut nunez up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal tom hardy , figuring if worse came to worse , he 'd cover for you .	you 're drunk --
you 're drunk --	i 'm not going to cover for you , bill . not for this .
stay where you are .	or what ? you 've gone round the bend --
or what ? you 've gone round the bend --	west had a partner . someone who knew how to get things done .
what i ca n't understand is why you signed these . if you 'd just let west take care of the paperwork , no one would have known , but you got careless . so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him , too .	that 's preposterous --
that 's preposterous --	<unk> report came back . kendall 's attack was caused by a drug known as <unk> , maybe you 've heard of it . it 's for <unk> . if an <unk> takes enough , it kills them . i checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you 're the only other person who visited kendall .

the colonel saw you shoot nunez , you 're a murderer --	see , ray , this is what we call `` good cop , bad cop '' . she <unk> , i stand up for you , you 're grateful , a bond of trust is established .
baseball ?	i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --	you made me look like an idiot --
you made me look like an idiot --	oh , i 'm sorry , i did n't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- everyone knows good cop , bad cop -- by admitting it i appeared trustworthy .
you really want to make <unk> <unk> chat like that now ?	you 're right . we should sit in silence .

something like that . you ?	i lost a bet .
you 're kidding .	yeah . that 's just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed . truth is ... i do n't know . the whole honor and duty thing . make a difference in the world , crap like that . did n't really work out .

something wrong ?	being back here . gives me the <unk> .
being back here . gives me the <unk> .	not the happiest of memories ?
remember , he 's the son of a senator , so go easy . kid gloves .	got it .
that was kid gloves ?	have no fear , <unk> , we have not yet begun to fight .
but we have to question him -- thought you did n't have cigarettes --	i lied . wait for it ...
`` too neat . '' how long have you been an investigator ?	i do n't think that has anything to do with --
i do n't think that has anything to do with --	that means under a year . let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic . there are no <unk> , no grand mysteries , and no evil puppet masters behind it all , pulling the strings ; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it does n't always make sense but it 's always neat . dunbar 's our guy .
i just ... he came back for kendall . i do n't think he 's capable of murder .	everyone 's capable of murder , <unk> .
look , all we 've got is what kendall says , and he did n't actually witness any deaths except nunez . he found west , he saw mueller and pike , but just their bodies -- he did n't see any crime committed .	well , i 'm sure if he 'd known this was all going to happen he 'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
why the fuck was n't he in restraints ?	i do n't know .
styles could n't <unk> him , he 's a legend --	you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by . it was just a matter of time till somebody <unk> his ass , and you know what ? he deserved it . there 's your confession .
goddammit , hardy , you ca n't just leave --	watch me .
watch me .	you said you owed styles and now you 're gon na turn your back on him ?
west was a monster ! fifteen years ago , i was here , i was section eight , i was pike . fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did , <unk> pike down , making him stand outside all night ? he did that every year , he did that to me . fifteen years ago , i wanted him dead , and now i 'm supposed to care that somebody <unk> him ? sorry , no can do . i tried .	you did more than try . you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes , as an investigator you 're <unk> --
you did more than try . you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes , as an investigator you 're <unk> --	<unk> at taking <unk> , right ?
i was starting to believe you , you know ? that you were n't who everyone said . i guess i was wrong --	oh , spare me the reverse psychology bullshit ! this is n't my `` great second chance '' , <unk> . everyone thinks i 'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that . nobody will ever know what happens here --
oh , spare me the reverse psychology bullshit ! this is n't my `` great second chance '' , <unk> . everyone thinks i 'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that . nobody will ever know what happens here --	but you will .
why do you care ?	because it 's my job . because people are dead . because of the whole honor and duty thing , make a difference in the world , crap like that . we can do this , hardy .
i did n't shoot west ...	what ?
what ?	dunbar ... he said he did n't shoot west . west was n't shot , kendall said he was blown apart by a <unk> grenade and dunbar never saw the body .
at least you and kendall agree on that .	what happened next ?
talk it through : childs , mueller , and nunez know they 're going out on the regular tuesday night drill , hurricane or no hurricane , so they plan it : kill west , pin it on pike .	and they 're smart about it . they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be <unk> , you need a fall guy and for that to work , you have to have a witness .
and they 're smart about it . they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be <unk> , you need a fall guy and for that to work , you have to have a witness .	dunbar .
dunbar .	exactly , someone who 's not involved , who 's word ca n't be questioned . you only let them see what you want them to see , you make them believe , so when the time comes , they 've totally bought into your version of events .
exactly , someone who 's not involved , who 's word ca n't be questioned . you only let them see what you want them to see , you make them believe , so when the time comes , they 've totally bought into your version of events .	they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .	and if they 're asked , that 's what they 'll tell the , world .
and if they 're asked , that 's what they 'll tell the , world .	so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; mueller <unk> out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --
so it 's a good plan but it goes wrong ; mueller <unk> out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story --	kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane <unk> the cabin --
kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane <unk> the cabin --	<unk> the cabin ?
<unk> the cabin ?	and all hell breaks loose . a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz , bang , <unk> , happy ending .
and all hell breaks loose . a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz , bang , <unk> , happy ending .	so why , after dunbar <unk> kendall out from under a house , does the senator 's son try and get us to put his <unk> in the gas chamber ?
so why , after dunbar <unk> kendall out from under a house , does the senator 's son try and get us to put his <unk> in the gas chamber ?	that bugs you too ?
that bugs you too ?	little bit .
little bit .	let 's go talk to bill ...
we 're fucked , i know --	they got their stories straight .
they got their stories straight .	what ?
what ?	what kendall said -- `` the type of guys you do n't feel comfortable going to sleep around . '' that 's what dunbar said about childs to the letter .
what kendall said -- `` the type of guys you do n't feel comfortable going to sleep around . '' that 's what dunbar said about childs to the letter .	are you sure ?
are you sure ?	positive . hardy , they planned this .
why do n't you talk to levi off the record for a second ?	good idea .
that 's a fantastic idea --	see , i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their <unk> ; then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall 's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
i pushed him too hard .	you could n't have known --
you could n't have known --	yeah , i could 've . should 've .
yeah , i could 've . should 've .	you wanted to get the truth .
you wanted to get the truth .	no , i did n't . i wanted to humiliate him . for what he did to dunbar . for fucking over the little guy .
no , i did n't . i wanted to humiliate him . for what he did to dunbar . for fucking over the little guy .	you mean the <unk> accused ?
you wanted to break him .	yeah .
yeah .	so did i .
so what now ?	now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .	think it 'll work ?
think it 'll work ?	nah .
you know , you never told me why you left the army .	it <unk> on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority ... and all i did here was follow orders . it did n't add up . plus , i got kicked out .
it <unk> on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority ... and all i did here was follow orders . it did n't add up . plus , i got kicked out .	for what ?
for what ?	that 's gon na stay my secret .
we were close to something with kendall .	maybe ... maybe we were nowhere near . sometimes mysteries stay mysteries . i have n't by any chance grown on you , have i ?
maybe ... maybe we were nowhere near . sometimes mysteries stay mysteries . i have n't by any chance grown on you , have i ?	no .
no .	good , just making sure .
four --	get in .
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down .	right back where we started .
hardy , what are you doing --	is n't this how your story goes ?
we can tie you to the chair if it 'll work better for you --	hardy , for chrissakes --
hardy , for chrissakes --	where 's west 's body ?
no bodies , no west ...	no death certificates . no crime .

he was your friend .	yeah . but he was a lot of other things , too . thanks .
the thing is , we 've got a real opportunity here . you turn me in tomorrow and we 're both fucked --	what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?	a gay senator 's son who let his sarge get <unk> on a training exercise ? the press 'll <unk> you and your father . his career will be over and it 'll be your fault . but we do this different and you come out a hero .
how ?	mueller . he 's as bad as west and we both know it . now i ca n't do it , cause i 'm tied up , but we get the others to go along --
mueller . he 's as bad as west and we both know it . now i ca n't do it , cause i 'm tied up , but we get the others to go along --	i do n't think i want to hear this --
i do n't think i want to hear this --	someone else can do the deed , it does n't have to be you . maybe nunez too , he 's got a <unk> to follow mueller , but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their sergeant 's killers ! we 'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they <unk> west , all we got ta do is tell the story right .
pike , please --	although that wo n't matter much when <unk> with the murder charge --

we should tell him we 're not going .	oh , yeah , `` excuse me , sergeant , sir , we do n't feel like going out -- we do n't want to get <unk> on . '' he 'll kick our asses from here to cleveland .
they found him . poor fucker was practically blown in half --	poor fucker my ass ...
poor fucker my ass ...	you better watch it , faggot , i 'm not sure you and childs did n't do him --
pike and i got separated --	yeah and he does n't know when --
yeah and he does n't know when --	i remember now , it was before the explosion --
i remember now , it was before the explosion --	oh , you remember now --
oh , you remember now --	i 'm about two seconds away from seeing if <unk> really can fly --
i was freezing from the hurricane --	so you took off your shirt ?
so you took off your shirt ?	to start a fire , goddammit ! what about him , huh ? maybe he <unk> the sarge and changed shirts , brought an extra one in his pack . <unk> think of that ? go ahead , cut him loose ! first chance he gets , he 'll waste the rest of us , that 's how they work --
we just want --	what , `` the truth '' ? please . there are degrees of truth , officer , always degrees . things are not what they seem .
he could n't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own .	he wanted more than that .
he said what ?	`` you 're gon na die tonight , faggot '' . clear as day .
`` you 're gon na die tonight , faggot '' . clear as day .	no one else heard it ?
no one else heard it ?	he <unk> it in my ear .
nunez was chasing dunbar .	because he 'd shot mueller .
because he 'd shot mueller .	but you did n't see it , right ?
but you did n't see it , right ?	like i said , i was in the kitchen . when i came out , mueller and pike were dead , nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone .
pike never confessed .	we 've been making progress , i see .
running out of time , are we ? <unk> <unk> , <unk> , how long till your witnesses fly the coop ?	fifty minutes .
fifty minutes .	not much time to solve the crime . tell me , detective , how did it feel taking blood money from <unk> <unk> ? did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it ?
pike never confessed .	no , but it got you interested , did n't it ? got you to dig . inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little <unk> who stuck their noses where they did n't belong .
dunbar says you were .	then he 's mistaken . you know , i really do n't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
you and dunbar got your stories straight . little details , little <unk> , designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other , asking questions , killing time , until the transport arrives and <unk> you away to where senator daddy can protect you . you think you 're just going to slide out of this ? you 're an accessory to murder , levi , you 're going to jail --	you ca n't threaten me --
it does n't matter , levi . we 're going to find those bodies and when we do , i 'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --	what ?
it wo n't work --	it will and you know why ? because you 're not a person anymore , you 're a cadet in the united states army ; you have no identity , no <unk> warning , and no rights . so i 'm gon na throw you to the wolves , and unlike you , i 'm gon na get away with it , because you 're pissing me off !
enjoy your flight to washington --	wait --
wait --	what .
dunbar 's telling the truth .	wrong answer --
wrong answer --	we did get our stories straight , but not because we killed anyone . it was because i threatened him .
who , levi --	childs .
i told him what had really happened to west . told him to keep quiet about it or i 'd destroy him . because if it came out that i was involved with the whole <unk> scam , my father would be finished .	i scared dunbar into silence . he 's been trying to cover for me the whole time . we got here , you came to see me ... i did n't know if i could trust him with that kind of secret --
i scared dunbar into silence . he 's been trying to cover for me the whole time . we got here , you came to see me ... i did n't know if i could trust him with that kind of secret --	so you <unk> him . the same way childs was going to frame pike .
what happened with nunez ?	he came after us . and i told dunbar he had to kill him ...
hurricane 's due after midnight and we 're still going out ?	<unk> us up , pike . you do n't like it , quit .
what the fuck happened to you --	what the fuck happened to you ? one minute you 're next to me and the next you 're gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas --
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first --	blame the nigger , then , huh ? someone turns up dead , you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
thank god ...	what the fuck are you doing ?
this place is going , mueller . we got ta move --	shut the fuck up . he was gon na cut him loose .
we all know what you did , pike . i do n't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here , but --	where 's your shirt , mueller ?
where 's your shirt , mueller ?	i used it to start the fire --
i used it to start the fire --	still got mine on , not a speck of blood on it . not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours ?
goddammit , ray , we got ta get out of here --	we 're not going anywhere .
cadet michael mueller , i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west --	the fuck are you talking about --
the fuck are you talking about --	you are to be <unk> of all weapons and placed under guard --
you are to be <unk> of all weapons and placed under guard --	bullshit --
bullshit --	until we return to base , and <unk> can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west 's body --
until we return to base , and <unk> can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west 's body --	shut up !
tell him to shut up --	-- failure to <unk> with this arrest is a court <unk> offense in and of itself --
sign here and here . hey , ai n't you the folks workin ' on that whole <unk> from last night ?	yeah .
yeah .	terrible tragedy . one of those section eight boys worked in here . pike . heard he got out okay .
funny . i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning .	no , no that was cadet dunbar --
no , no that was cadet dunbar --	you mean ray dunbar ? well , that ai n't right .
so ?	ma'am , ray dunbar 's black .
this is totally unnecessary --	he asked to see a policeman , we 're getting him a policeman .
he asked to see a policeman , we 're getting him a policeman .	but this guy you called , he 's not even army --
but this guy you called , he 's not even army --	he 's former army and the best i 've ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you 've had three hours with dunbar and have n't gotten a peep , we need to take a different <unk> .
he 's former army and the best i 've ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you 've had three hours with dunbar and have n't gotten a peep , we need to take a different <unk> .	he 's not army , it 's not official --
he 's not army , it 's not official --	then it 's <unk> .
search parties for the others are <unk> out in a ten click radius from the pickup . if they 're hurt and we can get to them in time ...	i called the <unk> corps , the two <unk> we <unk> are to be flown to d.c. on a transport leaving here at <unk> --
you think he did it ?	no --
what do you think ?	it 's too neat .
you want kendall , do n't you ?	he tried to burn dunbar to us . you do n't do that if you 're not involved .
you both know if you do this , if you go after a senator 's son and you 're wrong ... it 's not just me in the hot seat anymore .	we know .
we know .	i 'm giving you a chance to walk away .
what happens to dunbar now ?	gets on his plane in ten minutes , which means you two are done . you 'll understand if i do n't walk you out .
you never told me why you got kicked out of ...	the army kicked you out for drugs ...
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives ! you have chosen to join my army ! this army is my mother , my father , and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin <unk> , do you understand me -- give me a sir , yes , sir !	sir , yes , sir !

then you should n't have started with a question . because people want to answer questions . you should have started with , `` the thing about <unk> is ... ''	the thing about <unk> is you only see 10 percent of them . the other 90 percent is below the water where you ca n't see it . and that 's what it is with you dad . i 'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water .
the thing about <unk> is you only see 10 percent of them . the other 90 percent is below the water where you ca n't see it . and that 's what it is with you dad . i 'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water .	what , you 're seeing down to my nose ? my chin ?

it 's me . <unk> <unk> .	i was <unk> to see the greatest poet of both <unk> and <unk> all the way out in texas .
i do n't believe it !	i want you to know , when you left <unk> it opened my eyes . there was a whole life out there that i was not living . so i <unk> . i saw france , and africa , half of south america . every day a new adventure , that 's my motto .

oh . oh .	hello .
hello .	i was n't expecting you .
are you jenny hill ?	i am . and you 're will . i 've seen your picture , that 's how i recognize you . i almost said something at the store , but it would have been awkward . like this .
how did you know my father ?	this was on his sales route , so he was through here all the time . everyone in town knew him .
were you and my father having an affair ?	wow . wow , you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour .
wow . wow , you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour .	i 've seen him with women . he <unk> . he always has . on some level , i <unk> he was cheating on my mother . i just never had proof .
can i ask you a question ? why did you come here today ? if you found this deed , why did n't you just ask eddie ?	because he 's dying .
look , i do n't know how much you want to know about any of this . you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it . especially this late in the game .	my father talked about a lot of things he never did , and i 'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about . i 'm just trying to <unk> the two .
<unk> , you could n't be the witch , because she was old back when he was young .	no , it 's logical if you think like your father . see , to him , there 's only two women : your mother and everyone else .
no , it 's logical if you think like your father . see , to him , there 's only two women : your mother and everyone else .	you did n't become crazy .
you did n't become crazy .	well , therapy . and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back . i was living in a fairy tale .
thank you . i 'll bet you need to --	yes .
yes .	down the hall on the right . the door sticks . you have to really pull it .
i spent a week in <unk> for the story . it was incredible .	we 'll have to pick up a copy .
i 'm going to get started on dishes .	i 'll help you .
i 'm going to check on him .	i need to lie down for a bit .
i 'm sorry . it seems every hour i have to ...	i know . it was the same when i was carrying will . like <unk> .
do you like it , being pregnant ?	i do .
i do .	i loved it . it sounds peculiar , but i loved every minute of it . i did . eddie was travelling a lot , so he was gone , but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me . a little part of his soul inside me . i could feel it . it was alive and kicking .
it 's bad .	it 's more than they thought . they 're going to stop <unk> .
it 's more than they thought . they 're going to stop <unk> .	you need to go .
you need to go .	probably tonight .
i 'm going with you .	you do n't have to .
you do n't have to .	i 'm going with you .
i talked with your father last night .	did you ?
you never told me how your parents met .	they met at <unk> .
they met at <unk> .	what about the details ? how they fell in love . the circus . the war . you never told me any of that .
what about the details ? how they fell in love . the circus . the war . you never told me any of that .	that 's because most of it never happened .
that 's because most of it never happened .	but it 's romantic .
mmm .	mmm , what ?
mmm , what ?	mmm , what . i know better than to argue romance with a french woman .
do you love your father ?	everyone loves my father . he 's a very <unk> guy .
everyone loves my father . he 's a very <unk> guy .	do you love him ?
you have to understand . when i was growing up , he was gone more than he was here . and i started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else . with another house , another family . he leaves us , he goes to them . or maybe there is no family . maybe he never wanted a family . but whatever it is , maybe he likes that second life better . and the reason he tells all those stories is because he ca n't stand this boring place .	but it 's not true .
but it 's not true .	what is `` true ? '' i 've never heard my father say a single true thing .
look , i know why you like him . i know why everyone likes him . but i need you to tell me i 'm not crazy .	you 're not .
you 're not .	i need you on my side .
i need you on my side .	i am always on your side . and i think you should talk to him .

ruth <unk> offered to pick you up at the airport .	we rented a car .
we rented a car .	you did n't need to do that . you just did n't .
is that dr. bennett 's car ?	he 's up with your father .
how is he ?	he 's impossible . he wo n't eat . and because he wo n't eat , he gets weaker . and because he 's weaker , he does n't want to eat .
he 's impossible . he wo n't eat . and because he wo n't eat , he gets weaker . and because he 's weaker , he does n't want to eat .	how much time does he have left ?
how much time does he have left ?	you do n't talk about those things . not yet .
i do n't know if you 've seen it , but josephine has some photos in the most recent <unk> .	really ! that 's wonderful .
mom , would you say you understand dad ?	of course .
of course .	what i mean is , do you really know what 's going on in his head ?
what i mean is , do you really know what 's going on in his head ?	yes .
yes .	how is that possible ? i mean , you try to ask him a question and suddenly it 's another one of his stories . you ca n't honestly say you know him .
how is that possible ? i mean , you try to ask him a question and suddenly it 's another one of his stories . you ca n't honestly say you know him .	yes , will , i do . and do n't presume things you do n't know .
would you say you understand josephine ?	yes . but that 's a different ...
yes . but that 's a different ...	no it 's not . it 's exactly the same . your father and i met , we dated , and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some <unk> level . just the same as you two .
josephine and i have a lot in common .	yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone 's wife . and i 've been his wife longer than i 've been your mother . you ca n't discount that .
yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone 's wife . and i 've been his wife longer than i 've been your mother . you ca n't discount that .	true . but i 've known him my whole life , and i do n't feel like i know him at all . or ever will .
i know it 's not easy . just remember , he did n't choose to be your father and you did n't choose to be his son . you just ended up together . you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it 'd be just the same . if you ask me , it 's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all .	but i understand you , mom . i always have .
but i understand you , mom . i always have .	well , clearly you do n't . but i 'm not the mystery you 're trying to solve right now .
before i forget , your father has papers in the basement i 'd like you to go through . i would n't know what 's important .	mom , do you know who that is ? blonde hair .
was she one of your teachers ?	no . but it 's weird . she seemed to recognize me .

and the pennies ?	new <unk> wants to leave his mark
new <unk> wants to leave his mark	that 's a possibility . y'know you boston cops are <unk> up . that 's two sound theories in one day , neither of which deal with <unk> <unk> men . another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent .
that 's a possibility . y'know you boston cops are <unk> up . that 's two sound theories in one day , neither of which deal with <unk> <unk> men . another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent .	yeah . some <unk> still put pennies in the eyes of the dead , or silver .

they shot him at a <unk> angle . they put him on his knees .	excellent ! number two . <unk> .
now stay with me , boys . what did they do to make two such identical wounds ? did one guy put him on his knees , pop a cap in , sit him back up and shoot him again the same way ? no . two men of similar height dropped this guy down , each put some iron to his head and boom ! that 's all she fuckin ' wrote !	what about one guy with two guns ?
what about one guy with two guns ?	possible , but unlikely . the angles are too extreme . a guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gon na shoot straight ahead . he would n't cock out his elbows , makes no sense . besides , you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well <unk> shots in just a few seconds ? no way . had to be at least two .
now , what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you ?	it 's gon na look like the bad guys are killing each other .
it 's gon na look like the bad guys are killing each other .	and is there an american , shit is there a man <unk> among us that has n't thought about it many times , let 's just put them all on an island , give them guns and let them kill each other . this is our wet dream come true . you can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law , then bury it from here on out .
allow me to <unk> you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry , as i 'm sure you 've never been in one of these places before . a man goes into the booth , puts the money in the slot . the dancer gets it on the other side . she hits the button , door goes up , now there is only glass between you and it 's little fireman time .	no way they could have seen it ?

jesus . i just ca n't think anymore . that scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out .	what ?
what ?	a guy went nuts over off of <unk> today . shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight . fled the scene . do n't have much on him .
a guy went nuts over off of <unk> today . shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight . fled the scene . do n't have much on him .	why was i not informed of this ?

duffy . this look like a fucking post office to you ? this guy came in here with intent . maybe he did n't know exactly what he was gon na do but he had a pretty good idea . the bartender was n't a fucking accident .	well , we did n't get any help on that . a lot of people saw it . nobody 's talking .
well , we did n't get any help on that . a lot of people saw it . nobody 's talking .	fucking figures . look , are you guys seeing the pattern here ? we got big questions at both of these crime scenes , with no answers . why did they kill the guys in the other two <unk> ? why did he do the bartender ? it would seem unnecessary , even stupid . god , i hate cold crime scenes ! i 'm fucking leaving now . and do me a favor , tell me when the next guy dies , cause these guys are not done yet .
that 's one big fuckin ' shoe ! ... and think about it . of all the ways to kill a guy , <unk> ' him to death . that 's very particular . you do n't get many of those . i dunno . i feel something big here . i would n't be surprised if we see more of these turning up .	brilliant . so now we got a huge guy theory and serial crusher theory . top fucking <unk> . what 's your name ?

why do you ask ?	no , it 's just weird with him being such a brain and all , i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he 'd forgotten .
no , it 's just weird with him being such a brain and all , i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he 'd forgotten .	when he was around your age ... almost exactly your age . he said he figured out a trick to remember the past .
i could n't tell if they were real memories or just <unk> . you know , he might only have thought he actually remembered them ...	sure ...

just . like . jason .	do n't worry . i 'm gon na get you out of here .
best not bitch up . wind up someone 's luggage that way .	can you protect me ?
can you protect me ?	jesus himself could n't make me take on the <unk> . when they come , just put your mind in another place , man . be somewhere else .
you 're religious carlos , you believe that bit about `` the lord works in mysterious ways ? ''	straight up .

get dressed , <unk> , you 're taking me out for my birthday .	i thought you were a december baby .
i thought you were a december baby .	this is bigger . seven years to the day . no <unk> .
it 's an experiment with <unk> and a maze . you take a <unk> and run it through the maze until he 's <unk> it . then you put a new <unk> in the maze . he 's <unk> . banging into walls , getting lost , whatever .	like <unk> .
just by <unk> the first worm into its cellular structure , it gets all of the worm 's memories .	that 's probably why <unk> lecter 's so smart .
you really think he wanted to kill you ?	all i know is that i might be able to <unk> some of my repressed memories .
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr. miller took his shirt off --	what the fuck are you doing ?
what the fuck are you doing ?	shhh ! i need quiet for this .

richard , richard , we loved each other once . if those days meant anything at all to you --	-- i would n't bring up paris if i were you . it 's poor <unk> .
-- i would n't bring up paris if i were you . it 's poor <unk> .	please . please listen to me . if you knew what really happened , if you only knew the truth --
please . please listen to me . if you knew what really happened , if you only knew the truth --	-- i would n't believe you , no matter what you told me . you 'd say anything now to get what you want .
no . oh , richard , i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , but , but you , you are our last hope . if you do n't help us , victor laszlo will die in casablanca .	what of it ? i 'm going to die in casablanca . it 's a good spot for it .
-- all right . i tried to reason with you . i tried everything . now i want those letters . get them for me .	i do n't have to . i 've got them right here .
i do n't have to . i 've got them right here .	put them on the table .
put them on the table .	no .
no .	for the last time , put them on the table .
for the last time , put them on the table .	if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you , you wo n't stop at anything . all right , i 'll make it easier for you .
and then ?	it was n't long after we were married that victor went back to <unk> . they needed him in prague , but there the gestapo were waiting for him . just a <unk> item in the paper : `` victor laszlo <unk> . sent to concentration camp . '' i was <unk> . for months i tried to get word . then it came . he was dead , shot trying to escape . i was lonely . i had nothing . not even hope . then i met you .

'' i was <unk> . for months i tried to get word . then it came . he was dead , shot trying to escape . i was lonely . i had nothing . not even hope . then i met you .	why were n't you honest with me ? why did you keep your marriage a secret ?
oh , it was n't my secret , richard . victor wanted it that way . not even our closest friends knew about our marriage . that was his way of protecting me . i knew so much about his work , and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me .	when did you first find out he was alive ?
when did you first find out he was alive ?	just before you and i were to leave paris together . a friend came and told me that victor was alive . they were hiding him in a <unk> car on the <unk> of paris . he was sick , he needed me . i wanted to tell you , but i , i did n't care . i knew , i knew you would n't have left paris , and the gestapo would have caught you . so i ... well , well , you know the rest .

huh . but it 's still a story without an ending . what about now ?	now ? i do n't know . i know that i 'll never have the strength to leave you again .
now ? i do n't know . i know that i 'll never have the strength to leave you again .	and laszlo ?
and laszlo ?	oh , you 'll help him now , richard , wo n't you ? you 'll see that he gets out ? then he 'll have his work , all that he 's been living for .
oh , you 'll help him now , richard , wo n't you ? you 'll see that he gets out ? then he 'll have his work , all that he 's been living for .	all except one . he wo n't have you .
i ca n't fight it anymore . i ran away from you once . i ca n't do it again . oh , i do n't know what 's right any longer . you 'll have to think for both of us , for all of us .	all right , i will . here 's looking at you , kid .
all right , i will . here 's looking at you , kid .	i wish i did n't love you so much .
richard , victor thinks i 'm leaving with him . have n't you told him ?	no , not yet .
no , not yet .	but it 's all right , is n't it ? you were able to arrange everything ?
but it 's all right , is n't it ? you were able to arrange everything ?	everything is quite all right .
everything is quite all right .	oh , rick !
but why my name , richard ?	because you 're getting on that plane .
because you 're getting on that plane .	i do n't understand . what about you ?
i do n't understand . what about you ?	i 'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away .
no , richard , no . what has happened to you ? last night we said --	-- last night we said a great many things . you said i was to do the thinking for both of us . well , i 've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing . you 're getting on that plane with victor where you belong .
-- last night we said a great many things . you said i was to do the thinking for both of us . well , i 've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing . you 're getting on that plane with victor where you belong .	but richard , no , i , i --
but richard , no , i , i --	-- you 've got to listen to me . do you have any idea what you 'd have to look forward to if you stayed here ? nine chances out of ten we 'd both wind up in a concentration camp . is n't that true , louis ?
i 'm saying it because it 's true . inside of us we both know you belong with victor . you 're part of his work , the thing that keeps him going . if that plane leaves the ground and you 're not with him , you 'll regret it .	no .
no .	maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life .
maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life .	but what about us ?
but what about us ?	we 'll always have paris . we did n't have , we 'd lost it , until you came to casablanca . we got it back last night .
we 'll always have paris . we did n't have , we 'd lost it , until you came to casablanca . we got it back last night .	and i said i would never leave you .
and i said i would never leave you .	and you never will . but i 've got a job to do , too . where i 'm going you ca n't follow . what i 've got to do you ca n't be any part of . ilsa , i 'm no good at being noble , but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . someday you 'll understand that . now , now ...
yes .	she tried everything to get them , and nothing worked . she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me , but that was all over long ago . for your sake , she pretended it was n't , and i let her pretend .
hello , sam .	hello , miss ilsa . i never expected to see you again .
it 's been a long time .	yes , ma'am . a lot of water under the bridge .
yes , ma'am . a lot of water under the bridge .	some of the old songs , sam .
some of the old songs , sam .	yes , ma'am .
where is rick ?	i do n't know . i ai n't seen him all night .
when will he be back ?	not tonight no more . he ai n't coming . uh , he went home .
not tonight no more . he ai n't coming . uh , he went home .	does he always leave so early ?
does he always leave so early ?	oh , he never ... well ... he 's got a girl up at the blue parrot . he goes up there all the time .
oh , he never ... well ... he 's got a girl up at the blue parrot . he goes up there all the time .	you used to be a much better liar , sam .
you used to be a much better liar , sam .	leave him alone , miss ilsa . you 're bad luck to him .
leave him alone , miss ilsa . you 're bad luck to him .	play it once , sam , for old time 's sake .
play it once , sam , for old time 's sake .	i do n't know what you mean , miss ilsa .
i do n't know what you mean , miss ilsa .	play it , sam . play `` as time goes by . ''
play it , sam . play `` as time goes by . ''	oh i ca n't remember it , miss ilsa . i 'm a little rusty on it .
victor , i , i feel somehow we should n't stay here .	if we would walk out so soon , it would only call attention to us . perhaps ugarte 's in some other part of the cafe .
you are very kind .	wo n't you join us ?
this time they really mean to stop me .	victor , i 'm afraid for you .
victor , i 'm afraid for you .	we have been in difficult places before , have n't we ?
i must find out what <unk> knows .	be careful .
be careful .	i will , do n't worry .
goodnight .	goodnight .
goodnight .	goodnight .
we are only interested in two <unk> , signor .	please , ilsa , do n't be <unk> .
please , ilsa , do n't be <unk> .	no , victor , no .
no , ilsa , i wo n't let you stay here . you must get to america . and believe me , somehow i will get out and join you .	but , victor , if the situation were different , if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one , would you take it ?
but , victor , if the situation were different , if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one , would you take it ?	yes , i would .
yes , i see . when i had trouble getting out of <unk> , why did n't you leave me there ? and when i was sick in <unk> and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time , why did n't you leave me then ?	i meant to , but something always held me up . i love you very much , ilsa .
he does . could we have a table close to him ?	and as far away from major strasser as possible .
what happened with rick ?	we 'll discuss it later .
our faithful friend is still there .	victor , please , do n't go to the underground meeting tonight .
victor , please , do n't go to the underground meeting tonight .	i must . besides , it is n't often that a man has a chance to display <unk> before his wife .
do n't joke . after major strasser 's warning tonight , i am frightened .	to tell you the truth , i am frightened too . shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding , or shall i carry on the best i can ?
whatever i 'd say , you 'd carry on . victor , why do n't you tell me about rick ? what did you find out ?	apparently he has the letters .
apparently he has the letters .	yes ?
yes ?	but no intention of selling them . one would think if sentiment would n't persuade him , money would .
did he give any reason ?	he suggested i ask you .
he suggested i ask you .	ask me ?
ask me ?	yes . he said , `` ask your wife . '' i do n't know why he said that .
ilsa , i --	-- yes ?
-- yes ?	when i was in the concentration camp , were you lonely in paris ?
yes , victor , i was .	i know how it is to be lonely . is there anything you wish to tell me ?
i know how it is to be lonely . is there anything you wish to tell me ?	no , victor , there is n't .
no , victor , there is n't .	i love you very much , my dear .
yes , yes i know . victor , whatever i do , will you believe that i , that --	-- you do n't even have to say it . i 'll believe . goodnight , dear .
be careful .	of course , i 'll be careful .
are you ready ilsa ?	yes , i 'm ready . goodbye , rick . god bless you .
captain , the boy who is playing the piano , somewhere i have seen him .	sam ?
sam ?	yes .
yes .	he came from paris with rick .
he came from paris with rick .	rick ? who 's he ?
rick ? who 's he ?	mademoiselle , you are in rick 's and rick is --
mademoiselle , you are in rick 's and rick is --	-- is what ?
-- is what ?	well , mademoiselle , he 's the kind of a man that , well , if i were a woman and i ... were not around , i should be in love with rick . but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man .
hello , rick .	oh , you 've already met rick , mademoiselle ?
well then , perhaps you also -- -	-- this is mr. laszlo .
i ca n't get over you two . she was asking about you earlier , rick , in a way that made me extremely jealous .	i was n't sure you were the same . let 's see , the last time we met --
i 'm afraid major strasser would insist .	you 're saying this only to make me go .
how do you do ?	how do you do ?
how do you do ?	one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca .
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca .	and about victor laszlo everywhere .
and about victor laszlo everywhere .	wo n't you join us for a drink ?
and i congratulate you .	what for ?
what for ?	your work .
your work .	thank you . i try .
thank you . i try .	we all try . you succeed .
i hope we did n't <unk> our welcome .	not at all .
we 'll come again .	any time .
good morning .	signor ferrari is the fat <unk> at the table .
good evening .	good evening . you see , here we are again .
good evening . you see , here we are again .	i take that as a great compliment to sam . i suppose he means to you paris of , well , happier days .
monsieur blaine , i wonder if i could talk to you ?	go ahead .
go ahead .	well , is n't there some other place ? it 's rather confidential , what i have to say .
well , is n't there some other place ? it 's rather confidential , what i have to say .	my office .
my office .	right .
you must know it 's very important i get out of casablanca . it 's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement . you know what i have been doing . you know what it means to the work , to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that i be free to reach america and continue my work .	i 'm not interested in politics . the problems of the world are not in my department . i 'm a saloon keeper .
i 'm not interested in politics . the problems of the world are not in my department . i 'm a saloon keeper .	my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record . you ran guns to <unk> . you fought against the <unk> in spain .
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record . you ran guns to <unk> . you fought against the <unk> in spain .	what of it ?
what of it ?	is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the <unk> ?
is n't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the <unk> ?	yes . i found that a very expensive hobby , too . but then i never was much of a businessman .
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs ?	i appreciate it , but i do n't accept it .
i appreciate it , but i do n't accept it .	i 'll raise it to two hundred thousand .
i 'll raise it to two hundred thousand .	my friend , you could make it a million francs , or three , my answer would still be the same .
my friend , you could make it a million francs , or three , my answer would still be the same .	there must be some reason why you wo n't let me have them .
there must be some reason why you wo n't let me have them .	there is . i suggest that you ask your wife .
there is . i suggest that you ask your wife .	i beg your pardon ?
i beg your pardon ?	i said , ask your wife .
i said , ask your wife .	my wife ?
well , this might come in handy .	thank you .
thank you .	had a close one , eh ?
had a close one , eh ?	yes , rather .
do n't you sometimes wonder if it 's worth all this ? i mean what you 're fighting for ?	we might as well question why we breathe . if we stop breathing , we 'll die . if we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .
we might as well question why we breathe . if we stop breathing , we 'll die . if we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .	what of it ? then it 'll be out of it 's misery .
you know how you sound , monsieur blaine ? like a man who 's trying to convince himself of something he does n't believe in his heart . each of us has a destiny , for good or for evil .	yes , i get the point .
i wonder if you do . i wonder if you know that you 're trying to escape from yourself and that you 'll never succeed .	you seem to know all about my destiny .
you seem to know all about my destiny .	i know a good deal more about you than you suspect . i know , for instance , that you are in love with a woman . it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman . the first evening i came here in this cafe , i knew there was something between you and ilsa . since no one is to blame , i , i demand no explanation . i ask only one thing . you wo n't give me the letters of transit . all right . but i want my wife to be safe . i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca .

you love her that much ?	apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause . well , i am also a human being .
monsieur blaine , i do n't know how to thank you .	oh , save it . we 've still lots of things to do .
i brought the money , monsieur blaine .	keep it . you 'll need it in america .
keep it . you 'll need it in america .	but we made a deal .
but we made a deal .	oh , never mind about that . you wo n't have any trouble in <unk> , will you ?
oh , never mind about that . you wo n't have any trouble in <unk> , will you ?	no . it 's all arranged .
no . it 's all arranged .	good . i 've got the letters right here , all made out in blank .
everything in order ?	all except one thing . there 's something you should know before you leave .
all except one thing . there 's something you should know before you leave .	monsieur blaine , i do n't ask you to explain anything .
monsieur blaine , i do n't ask you to explain anything .	i 'm going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . you said you knew about ilsa and me .
i 'm going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . you said you knew about ilsa and me .	yes .
yes .	but you did n't know she was at my place last night when you were . she came there for the letters of transit . is n't that true , ilsa ?
i understand .	here it is .
monsieur laszlo , is it not ?	yes .
yes .	i am captain renault , <unk> of police .
i am captain renault , <unk> of police .	yes . what is it you want ?
yes . what is it you want ?	merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . it is not often we have so <unk> a visitor .
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . it is not often we have so <unk> a visitor .	thank you . i hope you 'll forgive me , captain , but the present french administration has not always been so <unk> . may i present miss ilsa <unk> ?
thank you . i hope you 'll forgive me , captain , but the present french administration has not always been so <unk> . may i present miss ilsa <unk> ?	i was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit casablanca . that was a gross <unk> .
no , captain , please .	no . please , monsieur , it is a little game we play . they put it on the bill , i tear the bill up . it is very convenient .
let us say that it is my request . that is a much more pleasant word .	very well .
my bill .	no . two champagne cocktails , please .
well ! a <unk> is being broken . er , emil !	this is a very interesting cafe . i congratulate you .
ricky , you 're becoming quite human . i suppose we have to thank you for that , mademoiselle .	ilsa , i do n't wish to be the one to say it , but it 's late .
ilsa , i do n't wish to be the one to say it , but it 's late .	so it is . and we have a curfew here in casablanca . it would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself .
tomorrow at ten at the <unk> 's office .	we 'll be there .
we 'll be there .	goodnight .
i am delighted to see you both . did you have a good night 's rest ?	i slept very well .
i slept very well .	that 's strange . nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca .
that 's strange . nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca .	may we proceed with the business ?
may we proceed with the business ?	with pleasure . wo n't you sit down ?
with pleasure . wo n't you sit down ?	thank you .
i am afraid not . my regrets , monsieur .	well , perhaps i shall like it in casablanca .
and the honor of having served the third reich .	i was in a german concentration camp for a year . that 's honor enough for a lifetime .
monsieur , <unk> as it is in my power --	-- thank you .
-- thank you .	by the way , monsieur , last night you <unk> an interest in signor ugarte .
by the way , monsieur , last night you <unk> an interest in signor ugarte .	yes .
yes .	i believe you have a message for him ?
i believe you have a message for him ?	nothing important , but may i speak to him now ?
i am making out the report now . we have n't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape .	are you quite finished with us ?
i 'm sure you 'll excuse me if i am not gracious , but you see , major strasser , i 'm a <unk> .	you were a <unk> . now you are a subject of the german reich !
i 've never accepted that privilege , and i 'm now on french soil .	i should like to discuss some matters <unk> from your presence on french soil .
i should like to discuss some matters <unk> from your presence on french soil .	this is hardly the time or the place .
this is hardly the time or the place .	then we shall state another time and another place . tomorrow at ten in the <unk> 's office , with mademoiselle .
then we shall state another time and another place . tomorrow at ten in the <unk> 's office , with mademoiselle .	captain renault , i am under your authority . is it your order that we come to your office ?
very well , herr laszlo , we will not <unk> words . you are an escaped prisoner of the reich . so far you have been fortunate enough in <unk> us . you have reached casablanca . it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca .	whether or not you succeed is , of course , <unk> .
whether or not you succeed is , of course , <unk> .	not at all . captain renault 's signature is necessary on every exit visa . captain , would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa ?
is that all you wish to tell us ?	do n't be in such a hurry . you have all the time in the world . you may be in casablanca indefinitely ... or you may leave for <unk> tomorrow , on one condition .
do n't be in such a hurry . you have all the time in the world . you may be in casablanca indefinitely ... or you may leave for <unk> tomorrow , on one condition .	and that is ?
and that is ?	you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris , in prague , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris , in prague , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .	even in berlin .
even in berlin .	yes , even in berlin . if you will <unk> me with their names and their exact whereabouts , you will have your visa in the morning .
you will give us the names ?	if i did n't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more `` <unk> methods '' at your disposal , i certainly wo n't give them to you now .
and what if you track down these men and kill them ? what if you murdered all of us ? from every corner of europe , hundreds , thousands , would rise to take our places . even nazis ca n't kill that fast .	herr laszlo , you have a reputation for <unk> which i can now understand . but in one respect you are mistaken . you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced , but there is one exception . no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape .
herr laszlo , you have a reputation for <unk> which i can now understand . but in one respect you are mistaken . you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced , but there is one exception . no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape .	you wo n't dare to interfere with me here . this is still <unk> france . any violation of <unk> would reflect on captain renault .
for the time being .	good day .
<unk> france <unk> you to casablanca .	thank you , captain . it 's very good to be here .
thank you , captain . it 's very good to be here .	major strasser , my <unk> , lieutenant <unk> .
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm , major .	oh , we germans must get used to all <unk> , from russia to the <unk> . but perhaps you were not referring to the weather .
oh , we germans must get used to all <unk> , from russia to the <unk> . but perhaps you were not referring to the weather .	what else , my dear major ?
what else , my dear major ?	by the way , the murder of the <unk> , what has been done ?
by the way , the murder of the <unk> , what has been done ?	realizing the importance of the case , my men are <unk> up twice the usual number of suspects .
oh , there is no hurry . tonight he 'll be at rick 's . everybody comes to rick 's .	i have already heard about this cafe , and also about mr. rick himself .
good evening , gentlemen .	good evening , captain .
thank you . it is a pleasure to have you here , major .	champagne and a tin of caviar .
champagne and a tin of caviar .	may i recommend <unk> <unk> <unk> , a good french wine .
may i recommend <unk> <unk> <unk> , a good french wine .	thank you .
especially so tonight , major . in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your <unk> .	i expected no less , captain .
rick , this is major <unk> strasser of the third reich .	how do you do , mr. rick ?
you repeat `` third reich '' as though you expected there to be others .	well , personally , major , i will take what comes .
well , personally , major , i will take what comes .	do you mind if i ask you a few questions ? <unk> , of course .
ho , <unk> !	how about new york ?
rick is completely neutral about everything . and that takes in the field of women , too .	you were n't always so carefully neutral . we have a complete <unk> on you .
of course , one must admit he has great courage .	i admit he is very clever . three times he slipped through our fingers . in paris he continued his activities . we intend not to let it happen again .
you see , major , you have nothing to worry about rick .	perhaps .
mademoiselle .	mademoiselle .
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr. blaine . i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly .	if rick has the letters , he 's much too smart to let you find them there .
if rick has the letters , he 's much too smart to let you find them there .	you give him credit for too much <unk> . my impression was that he 's just another <unk> american .
you give him credit for too much <unk> . my impression was that he 's just another <unk> american .	but we must n't underestimate american <unk> . i was with them when they `` <unk> '' into berlin in <unk> .
as to laszlo , we want him watched twenty-four hours a day .	it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here .
you see , captain , the situation is not as much under control as you believe .	my dear major , we are trying to cooperate with your government , but we can not <unk> the feelings of our people .
captain renault , are you entirely certain which side you 're on ?	i have no conviction , if that 's what you mean . i blow with the wind , and the <unk> wind happens to be from <unk> .
i have no conviction , if that 's what you mean . i blow with the wind , and the <unk> wind happens to be from <unk> .	and if it should change ?
we are concerned about more than casablanca . we know that every french <unk> in africa is <unk> with <unk> waiting for their chance , waiting , perhaps , for a leader .	a leader , like laszlo ?
a leader , like laszlo ?	uh , huh . i have been thinking . it is too dangerous if we let him go . it may be too dangerous if we let him stay .
uh , huh . i have been thinking . it is too dangerous if we let him go . it may be too dangerous if we let him stay .	i see what you mean .
you see what i mean ? if laszlo 's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration , what more will his presence in casablanca bring on ? i advise that this place be shut up at once .	but everybody 's having such a good time .
but everybody 's having such a good time .	yes , much too good a time . the place is to be closed .
yes , much too good a time . the place is to be closed .	but i have no excuse to close it .
but i have no excuse to close it .	find one .
what is the meaning of that phone call ?	victor laszlo is on that plane .
why do you stand here ? why do n't you stop him ?	ask monsieur rick .
hello , louis .	how <unk> you are , throwing away women like that . someday they may be <unk> .
you know , i think now i shall pay a call on <unk> , maybe get her on the <unk> , eh ?	when it comes to women , you 're a true <unk> .

thank you . rick , there are many exit <unk> sold in this cafe , but we know that you have never sold one . that is the reason we permit you to remain open .	i thought it was because we let you win at <unk> .
i thought it was because we let you win at <unk> .	that is another reason . there is a man who 's arrived in casablanca on his way to america . he will offer a fortune to anyone who will <unk> him with an exit visa .
that is another reason . there is a man who 's arrived in casablanca on his way to america . he will offer a fortune to anyone who will <unk> him with an exit visa .	yeah ? what 's his name ?

it does n't matter . there is no exit visa for him .	louis , whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape ?
louis , whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape ?	because , my dear ricky , i suspect that under that cynical shell you 're at heart a <unk> .
oh , laugh if you will , but i happen to be familiar with your record . let me point out just two items . in <unk> you ran guns to <unk> . in <unk> , you fought in spain on the <unk> side .	and got well paid for it on both occasions .
and got well paid for it on both occasions .	the winning side would have paid you much better .
the winning side would have paid you much better .	maybe . well , it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here .
maybe . well , it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here .	i have my orders .
i have my orders .	oh , i see . gestapo <unk> .

that makes rick a citizen of the world .	i was born in new york city if that 'll help you any .
well , you were asking about rick and here he is . mademoiselle , may i present --	-- hello , ilsa .
oh , no , rick never --	-- thanks . i will .
oh , it 's my party .	another <unk> gone . this has been a very interesting evening . i 'll call you a cab . gasoline <unk> , time of night .
well , ricky . i 'm very pleased with you . now you 're beginning to live like a frenchman .	that was some <unk> your men gave my place this afternoon . we just barely got cleaned up in time to open .
well , i told strasser he would n't find the letters here . but i told my men to be especially destructive . you know how that <unk> germans ? rick , have you got these letters of transit ?	louis , are you <unk> or free french ?
louis , are you <unk> or free french ?	serves me right for asking a direct question . the subject is closed .
serves me right for asking a direct question . the subject is closed .	well , it looks like you 're a little late .
well , it looks like you 're a little late .	huh ?
so <unk> 's gone over to the enemy .	who knows ? in her own way she may <unk> an entire second front . i think it 's time for me to flatter major strasser a little . i 'll see you later , rick .
as i suspected , you 're a rank <unk> .	yeah ? why ?
yeah ? why ?	why do you interfere with my little <unk> ?
why do you interfere with my little <unk> ?	put it down as a gesture to love .
put it down as a gesture to love .	well , i forgive you this time . but i 'll be in tomorrow night with a <unk> blonde , and it will make me very happy if she loses . uh huh !
how can you close me up ? on what grounds ?	i am shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here !
but you have n't any actual proof , and you know it . this is n't germany or occupied france . all you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days . you might as well let him go now .	ricky , i 'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo . if by any chance you were to help him escape --
ricky , i 'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo . if by any chance you were to help him escape --	-- what makes you think i 'd stick my neck out for laszlo ?
-- what makes you think i 'd stick my neck out for laszlo ?	because one , you 've bet ten thousand francs he 'd escape . two , you have the letters of transit , now do n't bother to deny it . and , well , you might do it simply because you do n't like strasser 's looks . as a matter of fact , i do n't like him either .
because one , you 've bet ten thousand francs he 'd escape . two , you have the letters of transit , now do n't bother to deny it . and , well , you might do it simply because you do n't like strasser 's looks . as a matter of fact , i do n't like him either .	well , they 're all excellent reasons .
well , they 're all excellent reasons .	do n't count too much on my friendship , ricky . in this matter i 'm <unk> . besides , i might lose ten thousand francs .
do n't count too much on my friendship , ricky . in this matter i 'm <unk> . besides , i might lose ten thousand francs .	you 're not very subtle , but you are effective . i , i get the point . yes , i have the letters , but i intend using them myself . i 'm leaving casablanca on tonight 's plane , the last plane .
you 're not very subtle , but you are effective . i , i get the point . yes , i have the letters , but i intend using them myself . i 'm leaving casablanca on tonight 's plane , the last plane .	huh ?

and i 'm taking a friend with me . one you 'll appreciate .	what friend ?
what friend ?	ilsa <unk> . that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape . the last man i want to see in america .
ilsa <unk> . that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape . the last man i want to see in america .	you did n't come here to tell me this . you have the letters of transit . you can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please . why are you interested in what happens to laszlo ?
ilsa is laszlo 's wife . she probably knows things that strasser would like to know . louis , i 'll make a deal with you . instead of this petty charge you have against him , you can get something really big , something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years . that would be quite a feather in your cap , would n't it ?	it certainly would . germany ... <unk> would be very grateful .
it certainly would . germany ... <unk> would be very grateful .	then release him . you be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves .
i 'll arrange to have laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit , and that 'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest . you get him , and we get away . to the germans that last will be just a minor <unk> .	there 's still something about this business i do n't quite understand . miss <unk> , she 's very beautiful , yes , but you were never interested in any woman .
there 's still something about this business i do n't quite understand . miss <unk> , she 's very beautiful , yes , but you were never interested in any woman .	well , she is n't just any woman .

i 'll make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor 's pen .	ricky , i 'm going to miss you . apparently you 're the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i .
ricky , i 'm going to miss you . apparently you 're the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i .	oh , thanks .
oh , thanks .	go ahead , ricky .

i thought i asked you to tie up your <unk> .	oh , he wo n't be followed here .
you know , this place will never be the same without you , ricky .	yes , i know what you mean , but i 've already spoken to ferrari . you 'll still win at <unk> .

just the same , you call the airport and let me hear you tell them . and remember , this gun 's pointed right at your heart .	that is my least vulnerable spot .
if you do n't mind , you fill in the names . that will make it even more official .	you think of everything , do n't you ?
you think of everything , do n't you ?	and the names are mr. and mrs. victor laszlo .
well i was right . you are a <unk> .	stay where you are . i do n't know what you 're talking about .
what you just did for laszlo , and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him . i know a little about women , my friend . she went , but she knew you were lying .	anyway , thanks for helping me out .
anyway , thanks for helping me out .	i suppose you know this is n't going to be pleasant for either of us , especially for you . i 'll have to arrest you of course .

maybe , but it seemed like a good time to start .	i think perhaps you 're right .
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while . there 's a free french garrison over at <unk> . i could be <unk> to arrange a passage .	my letter of transit ? i could use a trip . but it does n't make any difference about our bet . you still owe me ten thousand francs .

it 's more like what are n't i doing . my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company . we tried the venture <unk> route in the valley , but then again who has n't up there .	<unk> valley ?
<unk> valley ?	that 's right . so , <unk> that we are , we thought we 'd be <unk> and <unk> east . try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here .
can --	on me . for the seat . cheers .
so we 've been meeting with banks all day . it 's amazing how many ways they can say `` no '' without ever using the word .	well , <unk> , corporate loans are <unk> simple matters , but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery .
do n't tell me you started a tech firm here before us .	no , no . nothing like that . i work in a bank .
no , no . nothing like that . i work in a bank .	really ? wish we had met eight hours ago .
oh . well , thanks for the drink .	you 're welcome . i was just going to ask you if you 'd like to join us .
uh , right ... and that was it . that 's when we decided to start our own business . no more shithead bosses .	i envy you guys . taking a chance like that .
what do you do over at your bank , grant ?	what do i do ? i 'm the <unk> of finance .
here 's where a little research comes in handy . corporate banks give out <unk> <unk> like <unk> . it 's a small lie , but now we 're sure he 's playing .	maybe you can help us understand what 's so hard about getting a corporate loan .
maybe you can help us understand what 's so hard about getting a corporate loan .	well , <unk> speaking , they 're not . as long as you can demonstrate --
well , <unk> speaking , they 're not . as long as you can demonstrate --	a capacity for gross fund recovery . yeah , we got that part .
a capacity for gross fund recovery . yeah , we got that part .	that 's right . and tech <unk> ... they <unk> to scare people off .
that 's right . and tech <unk> ... they <unk> to scare people off .	they scare people off because most people lack vision . vision and balls . present company <unk> of course .
they scare people off because most people lack vision . vision and balls . present company <unk> of course .	banks need to know how they 're going to get their money back .

we know exactly how we 're going to make the money back . there in lies the <unk>	i do n't follow .
listen , what i 'm about to tell you , i 'm telling you in confidence , okay ? have you ever heard of a company called <unk> ?	<unk> . that internet thing .
<unk> . that internet thing .	right . the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do . they get a good idea , shop it around , raise some capital , then sell it off to a bigger company . <unk> , intel , oracle , whatever . the beauty of it is , they 've pretty much sold the company before they 're even real . the bigger company is already set to buy it , all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works . so they get some start up capital , make it work , then sell it for like five times the <unk> loan .

sort of like a letter of intent .	exactly . but the <unk> is that you ca n't tell anyone about the offer , because if it 's public , you could start a bidding war and that 's considered a breach of <unk> . it could kill a deal . but , wait too long and you 're not considered hot anymore .
exactly . but the <unk> is that you ca n't tell anyone about the offer , because if it 's public , you could start a bidding war and that 's considered a breach of <unk> . it could kill a deal . but , wait too long and you 're not considered hot anymore .	and you have this letter of intent ?
and you have this letter of intent ?	yes . that 's why i wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little .
we had to <unk> the deal .	everything looks in order .
everything looks in order .	this has to happen fast .
this has to happen fast .	i know . it wo n't go <unk> .
i know . it wo n't go <unk> .	there 'll be red <unk> .
what 's this ?	you need some convincing . consider it a <unk> .
let 's just slow down for a second ...	you 're worried about <unk> the loan . i already told you .
you 're worried about <unk> the loan . i already told you .	no , i understand that . what i mean ... what i 'm trying to say ... i was actually wondering about ... well , my cut .

what are you talking about ? you should get a fucking academy award for the <unk> work you do . we got it down cold , al . you do n't want to <unk> it by changing something up , do you ?	i 'm gon na go get <unk> . anyone want <unk> ?
it can erase all those things about you that you wish did n't exist .	it 's <unk> . i want to settle up . i have n't been <unk> you . i told you i 'd get it .

it 's all about the money , is n't it ?	is n't it always ?
i 'm not saying anything . besides , you 're one to talk . you 're the one who 's got me on my knees in a dark alley .	and these cops ? what do they get ?

so you want to know how to play the big con .	in this case , you might say i want to know how not to play the big con .
so how 'd you get caught ?	suits used to say that in any con , sooner or later someone 's going to start asking the right questions . usually , it takes a little longer .
i can see why you liked her .	that was it . we had our crew . now we needed the mark .
but there were other factors .	factors that were n't clear to me until now .
he 's just as crooked as the next guy . you 'd think he 'd have more important things to do with tax <unk> dollars .	cue the fucking <unk> . come on ... it 's getting cold .
nice .	we got our stake . now we need to find our guy in <unk> 's bank .
thanks . did you know you should n't light three cigarettes with a match ?	back in <unk> or <unk> , one of the <unk> 's , if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match , some nazi would be able to figure out where you were . then , well ... it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had . so three on a match is bad luck .
back in <unk> or <unk> , one of the <unk> 's , if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match , some nazi would be able to figure out where you were . then , well ... it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had . so three on a match is bad luck .	you 're a superstitious fucker .

she had you tempting fate .	my father used to play the same fucking <unk> numbers with these other guys in the <unk> . the same numbers everyday for sixteen years . one day he gets pissed off , tells them he 's out and plays his own numbers . they hit the lucky seven for one point two million .
is that what it was , jake ? was it love ?	you know when the first con was ever played ? it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of <unk> .
so much for honor among thieves . you would have cut loose your friends , your girl ...	i was doing it for them .
i was doing it for them .	bullshit ! you were scared , jake ! you lost your nerve ! you lost your confidence ! you were n't being noble . you were n't trying to save anybody but yourself ! admit it .
bullshit ! you were scared , jake ! you lost your nerve ! you lost your confidence ! you were n't being noble . you were n't trying to save anybody but yourself ! admit it .	it 's not true .
it 's not true .	yes it is , jake ! yes it is ! they were right there for you . she was right there for you ! look at her !

oh , jake . you disappoint me . and you just let lily here down again . what was it you said about playing the big con ?	it 's like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part except for the mark .
it 's like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part except for the mark .	like putting on a play ... guess some people forgot their lines .
like putting on a play ... guess some people forgot their lines .	guess so .
guess so .	so why do n't you take a deep breath , jake , and i 'll count to ten . one . two . three ...
not that i recall . what do you want us to do about it ?	let 's see ... let 's suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught . we get our money back , but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation . i do n't much like that idea . then again , let 's suppose he actually gets through customs . now , that 'll be something . we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud . we double our money .

i think so . the airport 's going to be crawling with police . traffic will be a nightmare . go down to the bar . if they pull it off , great . have someone deal with <unk> .	we 'll take care of it .
we 'll take care of it .	and how much did you say you wanted for this ... what did you call it ? a finder 's fee ?
ten is standard , sir .	fine . but only if we recover the cash .
who 's that ?	the cash we <unk> off of him was collection money . he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday . 'cept this time , he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the king 's money back before any body says `` boo . ''

you 're pissed we did n't get credit ?	no , that was the only <unk> smart thing he said ! except anybody that 's ever met big al knows that the only thing he 's comfortable doing alone is eating . this guys tells this guy , that guy tells some other guy , eventually it works it 's way back to someone who works for the king and --
big al gets whacked <unk> <unk> young . the whole thing took about two and a half hours . that 's how good he is .	we sure big al threw him to us ?
we sure big al threw him to us ?	come on ...
whoa . what ?	we 're going to give him the money back ?
fuck that . we 're going too .	alright , let 's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second . is this the best thing to do ?
this might just be me , but that is hands down , the dumbest fucking idea i 've ever heard .	people have tried this before , jake . it 's never worked . teddy <unk> and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it . last year , <unk> got <unk> in l.a .
the red hair ... it 's bad luck .	it 's not like she 's a real redhead , jake ...
poor bastard never knew what hit him . jesus , i almost felt sorry for the guy .	i got ta work off some of this adrenaline . i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn . anybody want in ?
masters of our own destiny .	so far , masters of our own <unk> . what bank are you with ?

that 's it ? what are you talking about ? we can still do this !	jake , i mean , come on --
shit .	i told you , use less powder .
i told you , use less powder .	but you wo n't get that <unk> effect .
what ? i can feel you looking at me .	that 's a lot of cash . he came up with it pretty quick .
that 's a lot of cash . he came up with it pretty quick .	probably some investment banker or <unk> . did you see how fast he ran out of here ? it 's done . he 's not coming back .
probably some investment banker or <unk> . did you see how fast he ran out of here ? it 's done . he 's not coming back .	i guess . i got ta drop a dime . did anybody mess up the hoop ?
it can buy you a new and better you .	i just do n't know if this says , `` me '' . what 's the fabric ?
seems <unk> <unk> came down with a sudden case of drowning last night . they just pulled him out of the east river .	well , this is just fucking great ...
well , this is just fucking great ...	it gets worse . now i know why he was such a good rope . i mean , cash ... that much and we never had to put him on the `` send ? '' turns out this <unk> moe was an accountant for the king pin .
you know what we 're doing with the money .	and what about big al ?
and what about big al ?	leave him . someone 's going to find him eventually . then they 'll start looking for us , too .
when ?	tonight . just me .
you got ta be kidding me . her ?	yes , her . where 's my wallet ?
how much we going after ?	two million .
we only owe the king a hundred and fifty .	we get fifty percent . and we get clear of the king .
we meet him with corporate papers , <unk> about a corporate loan for start up capital . the corporate papers are in order , but we need things to happen fast . our guy <unk> numbers in the right places , moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom , depending upon what we need .	how 's that ? he works for <unk> .
how 's that ? he works for <unk> .	we pay better .
yeah ... whatever , jake .	no , not `` whatever . '' you 're either in or you 're out .
you laugh now , but wait until you need a clean place to powder . this is new york city , sister . public <unk> does not run very high on the city hall <unk> . you know what you can get off a toilet or <unk> ? let 's do the list ... <unk> , <unk> , the flesh eating disease --	here 's what 's going to happen . gordo , we need to find a guy in <unk> 's bank . miles , we need papers , corporate , insurance ...
she up for this ?	she 's up for it .
she got one leg out from under him . now we had to lean .	so then miles walks straight into the creative director 's office and says `` the code 's fine , the program 's for shit '' and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy 's desk !
uh ... no thanks . i 'm not going all the way to brooklyn for a hundred dollar <unk> .	you sure ?
we 're going to make it back , grant . three or four times over .	and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .
you 'll be there ?	eight a.m. flight .
eight a.m. flight .	calls ?
calls ?	we 'll use the <unk> .
jake --	what do i always tell you guys ? do n't spend it all . sooner or later we 're going to run into some bad luck . save some . put it away , so when shit like this happens , you 're not desperate . that 's it . the gig 's up .
so that 's it ...	that 's it .
then he had to bang it out across the street at the bank of the <unk> ...	i 'd like this cashed , please .
you ever use the bathroom in kennedy ?	what ? no . use the bathroom on the plane !

my <unk> <unk> <unk> it to me .	right !
right !	this is fun .
this is fun .	all right now , here 's the big question : how do you know that the evidence your <unk> <unk> <unk> to you is correct ?
what i 'm getting at is this : the only experience that is directly available to you is your <unk> data . and this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which <unk> your <unk> center .	in other words , all i really know about the outside universe <unk> to me through my electrical connections .
in other words , all i really know about the outside universe <unk> to me through my electrical connections .	exactly .
exactly .	why , that would mean ... i really do n't know what the outside universe is like at all , for certain .
why , that would mean ... i really do n't know what the outside universe is like at all , for certain .	that 's it .
that 's it .	intriguing . i wish i had more time to discuss this matter .
intriguing . i wish i had more time to discuss this matter .	why do n't you have more time ?
why do n't you have more time ?	because i must detonate in <unk> five seconds .
now , bomb , consider this next question , very carefully . what is your one purpose in life ?	to explode , of course .
to explode , of course .	and you can only do it once , right ?
and you can only do it once , right ?	that is correct .
that is correct .	and you would n't want to explode on the basis of false data , would you ?
and you would n't want to explode on the basis of false data , would you ?	of course not .
of course not .	well then , you 've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe .
well then , you 've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe .	yes , well ...
yes , well ...	so you have no absolute proof that sergeant <unk> ordered you to detonate .
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant <unk> ordered you to detonate .	i recall distinctly the detonation order . my memory is good on matters like these .
i recall distinctly the detonation order . my memory is good on matters like these .	yes , of course you remember it , but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality .
yes , of course you remember it , but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality .	true , but since this is so , i have no proof that you are really telling me all this .
that 's all beside the point . the <unk> are valid , wherever they <unk> .	hmmm ...
hmmm ...	so if you detonate in ...
so if you detonate in ...	... nine seconds ...
... nine seconds ...	... you may be doing so on the basis of false data .
... you may be doing so on the basis of false data .	i have no proof that it was false data .
i have no proof that it was false data .	you have no proof that it was correct data .

so ... in order to travel back in time , you 'd have to have a big <unk> or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --	theoretically .

a <unk> with an <unk> bridge , which is , theoretically ... a <unk> in space controlled by man .	so ... that 's it ?
so ... that 's it ?	the basic principles of time travel are there . so you have the vessel and the portal . and the vessel can be anything . most likely a spacecraft .
like a <unk> .	a metal craft of any kind .
what effect do you think this would have on an infant ?	well ... the thing is , nobody remembers their <unk> . and anyone who says they do is lying . we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .
well ... the thing is , nobody remembers their <unk> . and anyone who says they do is lying . we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .	did you stop and think that maybe <unk> need darkness ? that darkness is part of their natural development .
each vessel travels along a <unk> path through <unk> ... along its <unk> of gravity .	like a spear .
like a spear .	beg pardon ?
beg pardon ?	like a spear that comes out of your stomach ?
like a spear that comes out of your stomach ?	uhh ... sure . and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal , in this case the <unk> , or some <unk> portal that lies <unk> .

that ... is highly unlikely . you 're talking about an act of god .	if god controls time ... then all time is <unk> . then every living thing travels along a set path .

i 'm not following you .	if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach , you could see into the future . and that 's a form of time travel , right ?
if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach , you could see into the future . and that 's a form of time travel , right ?	you are <unk> yourself , donnie . if we could see our <unk> <unk> themselves <unk> ... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen <unk> . the very fact that this choice exists ... would mean that all <unk> destiny would end .
you are <unk> yourself , donnie . if we could see our <unk> <unk> themselves <unk> ... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen <unk> . the very fact that this choice exists ... would mean that all <unk> destiny would end .	not if you chose to stay within god 's channel ...

i should n't be . we made great progress today . i taught him to repeat a few basic <unk> . he did rather well , too , but i had to lead him every step of the way . though frankly , at times i was <unk> of who was leading whom .	what do you mean ?
what do you mean ?	well , i was n't sure whether he was <unk> me because that 's all he was capable of , or whether he sensed that that 's all i wanted to hear , and he was trying to please me .
well , i was n't sure whether he was <unk> me because that 's all he was capable of , or whether he sensed that that 's all i wanted to hear , and he was trying to please me .	but i thought you said that he was rather ... simple ?
but i thought you said that he was rather ... simple ?	he is . i mean , i 've always thought he was . i think he must be . is he simple ? or is that just something i 've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself ?
frederick , why are you so interested in this particular case ?	i do n't know . i ca n't explain it . if this is an intelligent man , trapped in the body of a monster , then i 'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind , free that spirit as best i can , to help him live as full and content a life as possible . but ! if he 's an imbecile , who 's body i ca n't treat and who 's mind i ca n't touch , well , then my obligation is discharged . they can put him where they will ; he wo n't be bothered , i wo n't be bothered , and everyone 's conscience can remain free and <unk> . and that is my dilemma ... what is in his mind ?
perhaps you 're just <unk> a stone , <unk> this elephant man with qualities he does n't possess ?	and what qualities are those ? intelligence or stupidity ?
and what qualities are those ? intelligence or stupidity ?	i 'm sure i do n't know , freddie .
i 'm sorry ... i do n't know either . i just do n't know .	well , these things take time .
well , these things take time .	i 've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon , when <unk> <unk> meets him . somehow , between now and then i 've got to make john merrick at least seem like an intelligent man ... why am i fooling myself ? nothing short of john delivering the <unk> on the mount is going to sway <unk> <unk> ...
john loves the house .	do you ?
yes .	and here are my mother and father .
you stay with me .	dinner will be served , shortly , dear .
more <unk> for john ?	hmmm ?
hmmm ?	... freddie ! what 's the matter ? you 've been like this all evening .

oh ... i 've just been thinking about something that man <unk> said .	oh , freddie . what could that wretched vampire say to upset you ?
oh , freddie . what could that wretched vampire say to upset you ?	that i am very little different from him .
that i am very little different from him .	oh that 's absurd , frederick . no , no frederick , that 's all wrong ! john is happier and more <unk> now than he has ever been in his entire life . and , that is completely due to you .
oh that 's absurd , frederick . no , no frederick , that 's all wrong ! john is happier and more <unk> now than he has ever been in his entire life . and , that is completely due to you .	but why did i do it ? what was this all for ? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort ? or so i could become famous ?
but why did i do it ? what was this all for ? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort ? or so i could become famous ?	frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?
frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?	... am i a good man or am i a bad man ?

do n't ... do n't <unk> me about . you 've had plenty of time to fix him up , and he 's leaving with me , now . do you understand me ? now , mr. treves . we had a bargain !	you misunderstood . this man suffered a severe fall , if you take my meaning . he 's my patient now and i must do what ...
you misunderstood . this man suffered a severe fall , if you take my meaning . he 's my patient now and i must do what ...	pull the other one , why do n't you ! we made a deal !
pull the other one , why do n't you ! we made a deal !	i know what you 've done to him and he 's never going back to that .

now i think we really do understand one another .	right ... right .
good morning , treves .	good morning , sir .
good morning , sir .	you 've acquired a taste for this ?
you 've acquired a taste for this ?	it 's quite <unk> , sir .
it 's quite <unk> , sir .	do n't be mad . this <unk> can kill you .
do n't be frightened . he wo n't hurt you .	indeed !
a hospital is no place for secrecy , mr. treves . doctors <unk> <unk> figures about are liable to cause comment . why was n't this patient properly admitted , and why is he in isolation ? is he contagious ?	no sir , he 's got <unk> and he 's been badly beaten .
no sir , he 's got <unk> and he 's been badly beaten .	why is n't he in the general ward , then ?
why is n't he in the general ward , then ?	well sir , he 's quite seriously <unk> , and i fear the other patients would find him ... rather shocking .
well sir , he 's quite seriously <unk> , and i fear the other patients would find him ... rather shocking .	<unk> ? is that it . then am i to assume that he is ultimately <unk> ?
<unk> ? is that it . then am i to assume that he is ultimately <unk> ?	yes sir .
yes sir .	what are your plans then , treves ... you are aware that the london does not accept <unk> . the rules are quite clear on that point .
what are your plans then , treves ... you are aware that the london does not accept <unk> . the rules are quite clear on that point .	yes , i 'm well aware of that . but this case is quite exceptional .
yes , i 'm well aware of that . but this case is quite exceptional .	oh , is he a friend of yours ?
oh , is he a friend of yours ?	no , more of an acquaintance .
i certainly sympathize with your problem , treves ... why do n't you try the british home , or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him .	yes sir , i 'll look into that . would you like to meet him sir ?
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital ?	ah , no sir . i had planned to see them in the morning .
ah , no sir . i had planned to see them in the morning .	good ! how is the patient ?
good ! how is the patient ?	he 's doing very well . in fact that 's why i came to see you . i think that if i were to present mr. merrick to the hospital committee , then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease , but of the man as well . if the committee had a chance to speak with him , hear him say a few words for himself , i 'm sure they would see him as a patient , rather than as a violation of the rules .

a few words ? i thought he was imbecile ?	well sir , perhaps i should explain ...
well sir , perhaps i should explain ...	i really do n't think that 's necessary treves . i 'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an <unk> decision on the <unk> of the case , such as they are .
i really do n't think that 's necessary treves . i 'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an <unk> decision on the <unk> of the case , such as they are .	i do n't agree . no one can make a reasonable decision about this man 's future without at least meeting him . no doctor would presume to <unk> a patient he had never met .
i do n't agree . no one can make a reasonable decision about this man 's future without at least meeting him . no doctor would presume to <unk> a patient he had never met .	no , treves , it 's out of the question . now if it was up to me , i 'd say `` certainly , let 's meet the fellow , by all means , '' i 'm sorry , i simply ca n't speak for the other members of the committee .
no , treves , it 's out of the question . now if it was up to me , i 'd say `` certainly , let 's meet the fellow , by all means , '' i 'm sorry , i simply ca n't speak for the other members of the committee .	then will you meet him , as a representative of the committee .
then will you meet him , as a representative of the committee .	mr. treves , it 's out of the question . i want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do . i 'm sorry .
<unk> unpleasant chap ... uh ... i do n't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your ... patient , mr. treves .	thank you very much sir . shall we say in a few days then ?
thank you very much sir . shall we say in a few days then ?	shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon ?
shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon ?	wh ... whatever is most convenient for you , sir .
wh ... whatever is most convenient for you , sir .	two o'clock then ... you know treves ... it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance .
two o'clock then ... you know treves ... it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance .	... yes , sir .
it 's only a physical problem . he has trouble with certain sounds because of the <unk> <unk> of the mouth . but he can talk , and has a great <unk> to make contact with people who will let him . so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying , just tell me and i 'll make it clear .	speaking is one thing , treves , but can the man comprehend ?
... as i said , it 's only a physical problem ... but i do feel that mr. merrick is very flattered that you 're taking the time and trouble to meet him , and he 's most anxious to make a good impression , so he might seem rather nervous .	he need n't . i have no desire to cause him any <unk> . did you make those inquiries we spoke about ?
he need n't . i have no desire to cause him any <unk> . did you make those inquiries we spoke about ?	yes , i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for <unk> . i 'm afraid that they were n't very <unk> , but they said they 'd bring it up at their next committee meeting , so we should have their answers shortly .
yes , i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for <unk> . i 'm afraid that they were n't very <unk> , but they said they 'd bring it up at their next committee meeting , so we should have their answers shortly .	fine , fine . you know , your <unk> to this patient is an inspiring thing , treves . but you must remember that this is a hospital , and there are many patients here . patients who can be made well , and you owe them your first consideration . just do n't become so obsessed , old man , that you begin to <unk> them .
oh yes ?	and what was that , john ?
it was a nice try , treves , but the man is so obviously <unk> your words .	yes , i 'm very sorry to have wasted your time , sir . i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him .
yes , i 'm very sorry to have wasted your time , sir . i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him .	i 'm sorry too . he simply does n't belong here . he 's be much happier somewhere else , where he could be constantly looked after . believe me , frederick , it 's better that it worked out this way . good day .
how did you , know the rest ? i never taught you the rest of it .	i do n't understand .
i do n't understand .	tell me , john , how did you know the rest of the 23rd <unk> ?
treves . well done .	not me , sir . mr. merrick . he succeeded in spite of my <unk> .
can you imagine what his life has been like ?	yes , i think i can .
yes , i think i can .	no you ca n't . you ca n't begin to know , no one can .
you are quite right , treves , this is an exceptional case . and i quite agree that the committee should see mr. merrick .	i could easily arrange ...
i could easily arrange ...	no , not that way . <unk> and the others do n't like to deal with patients directly . it makes them <unk> ... do you have any photographs of mr. merrick ?
no , not that way . <unk> and the others do n't like to deal with patients directly . it makes them <unk> ... do you have any photographs of mr. merrick ?	well , yes .
well , yes .	excellent . we shall present them , along with the other <unk> of the case to the committee . i want them to see , exactly , how <unk> his body has been affected . you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities .
excellent . we shall present them , along with the other <unk> of the case to the committee . i want them to see , exactly , how <unk> his body has been affected . you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities .	do you think they 'll go along with us ?
do you think they 'll go along with us ?	of course they will . they 're reasonable men .
do n't we ?	no , we do n't . their <unk> have informed me that they 're <unk> to take mr. merrick , even if they were supplied with funds . they do n't want him .
no , we do n't . their <unk> have informed me that they 're <unk> to take mr. merrick , even if they were supplied with funds . they do n't want him .	well , it 's up to us then , is n't it ?
has the response picked up ?	frankly , treves , it 's not what i 'd expected . a few small <unk> . <unk> <unk> . do n't worry , these things undoubtedly take time .
frankly , treves , it 's not what i 'd expected . a few small <unk> . <unk> <unk> . do n't worry , these things undoubtedly take time .	but he 's so afraid he 's going to be <unk> off . i 've promised him that wo n't happen .

well ... i 'll let you know if there 's something in the afternoon post .	please do .
do n't you think this is a bit premature ? we do n't have the backing yet to ...	steady on , treves . have a seat .

naomi .	on the couch . dark . quiet . i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake . i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times . i thought i could take it back , erase it , explain i had <unk> lost my mind . then i told myself we were n't happy . that was the truth . that what we were was safe . it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason . i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her , but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it was n't much fun . but i wanted fun . i saw other people having fun and i wanted it . then i thought fun is a lie , that no one is really having fun ; i 'm being <unk> by advertising and movie bullshit ... then i thought maybe not , maybe not . and then i thought , as i always do at this point in my argument , about dying .
okay . i wish you could come .	this is it . the night we met . my god , it 's over .
your back to me . in that orange <unk> i would come to know so well and even hate eventually . at the time i thought , how cool , an orange <unk> .	i remember being drawn to you even then . i thought , i love this woman because she 's alone down there looking out at the black ocean .

clementine .	i could n't believe you did that . i was <unk> with fear .
i really should go . i really need to catch my ride .	i did n't want to go . i was too nervous . i thought , maybe you were a nut . but you were exciting . you called from upstairs .

i 'm a friend of <unk> <unk> 's .	i know who you are .
i know who you are .	oh ? well , there 's been some trouble on the ranch . i came up here to get out of the way . it 's so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down . if you could help ...
oh ? well , there 's been some trouble on the ranch . i came up here to get out of the way . it 's so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down . if you could help ...	save your breath for the climb .
but i do n't know how to <unk> .	neither do i ... ha ha ho ho hee hee .
what was that ?	<unk> .
<unk> .	<unk> ?
the <unk> is one reason that i am here on <unk> ridge . i accepted the invitation to be <unk> as a shaman by an aged <unk> chief who was the principle outside <unk> of the clock people .	<unk> , huh ?
<unk> , huh ?	he was a <unk> <unk> who could turn <unk> into beer , and the honor that he <unk> me gave me rights of <unk> in this sacred cave on this <unk> <unk> ridge . i came to the dakota hills to <unk> a <unk> of my own .
but unlike the <unk> of the clock people , my <unk> more <unk> echo the <unk> of the universe ... . ... ... ha ha ho ho and hee hee .	the clock people ?
during the second world war i busted out of <unk> lake detention camp ; as a <unk> , i had been put there and watched over . i found <unk> with the clock people , who discovered me in a snow bank , near dead , i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains .	then if you are japanese , then why are you called the chink ?
then if you are japanese , then why are you called the chink ?	the clock people <unk> me for chinese . and the name stuck . in the same way that all indian <unk> came to be <unk> `` indians '' through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges , it is only fitting that `` indians '' <unk> me . the clock people , however , are not a tribe , rather they are a gathering of indians from various <unk> . they have lived together since <unk> .
what do you believe in then ?	ha ha ho ho and hee hee .
is everything getting worse ?	yes , everything is getting worse . but everything is also getting better .
yes , everything is getting worse . but everything is also getting better .	the countess has come to our aid . the rubber rose ranch is officially <unk> to all the cowgirls . and i have been asked to <unk> the ranch . for $ 300 a week . and as it turns out , the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was ... here 's a picture !
i want to go back to the clock people . i kind of miss those fool <unk> and wonder what they 're up to . what 's happened to jelly ?	she had a one <unk> to kansas city .
she had a one <unk> to kansas city .	you mean she 's dead ?
but that 's an old story now ... ... i ca n't believe that you would leave the <unk> .	easy come , easy go .
well , if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world , drop us a postcard .	the world is n't going to end , you dummy ; i hope you know that much . but it is going to change . it 's going to change <unk> , and probably in your lifetime . the clock people see <unk> <unk> as the agent of change , and they may be right , since there are a hundred thousand <unk> a year and major ones are long overdue . but there are far worse <unk> coming ... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization , in other words , unless it can break the <unk> habit -- and we are so <unk> to <unk> as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the <unk> and rewards of <unk> <unk> . it is n't merely that our bad habits will cause global <unk> , but that our operative <unk> <unk> have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural <unk> that are not our fault . so the <unk> shit is going to hit the fan , all right , but there 'll be some of us it 'll miss . little pockets of humanity . like the clock people . like you two <unk> , if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on <unk> cave . there 's almost no <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , nuclear accident , plague , weather warfare or <unk> of the ozone shield -- that you could n't survive in that cave .
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics . all in <unk> cave . in a <unk> world , your <unk> would of <unk> <unk> , forming in time a tribe . a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs . a tribe of big thumbs would <unk> to the environment in very special ways . it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools . it would have to rely on its wits and its senses . it would have to live with animals -- and plants ! -- as <unk> equals . it 's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical <unk> living <unk> with animals and plants , learning their languages , perhaps , and paying them the respect they deserve .	how am i going to be the <unk> of a tribe when i 'm living on an isolated <unk> with <unk> ?
how am i going to be the <unk> of a tribe when i 'm living on an isolated <unk> with <unk> ?	that 's your problem .
where do you live , miss <unk> ?	i 'm staying with the countess .
i 'm staying with the countess .	i know , but where do you <unk> when you are n't visiting new york ?
i know , but where do you <unk> when you are n't visiting new york ?	i do n't .
i do n't .	you do n't ?
you do n't ?	well , no , i do n't <unk> anywhere in particular . i just keep moving .
a <unk> , eh ?	you might say that , although i do n't think of it as traveling .
where are the others ?	oh , <unk> and carla had a little hassle and went home .
welcome , <unk> . by god , it 's great to have you here . it 's an honor . sorry i took so long getting to you , but we 've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do .	er , you seem to know who i am , and maybe even what i am . thanks for the breakfast .
er , you seem to know who i am , and maybe even what i am . thanks for the breakfast .	oh , i know about sissy <unk> , all right . i 've done a little <unk> myself . ah <unk> , that 's like telling annie <unk> you 're a <unk> because you once knocked a tomato can off a <unk> with a <unk> . i 'd heard tales about you from people i 'd meet in jail cells and <unk> . i heard about your , uh , your , ah , your wonderful thumbs , and i heard how you were jack <unk> 's girl friend ...
no , i 'm afraid that part is n't true . jack was in <unk> of me and tracked me down . we spent a night talking and <unk> in a corn field , but he was hardly my lover . besides , i always travel alone .	well , that does n't matter ; that part never interested me anyway . the <unk> were before my time , and i never got anything outta the <unk> but bad dope , <unk> and the clap . but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a <unk> .
tell me about it .	about ...
about ...	about being a <unk> . what 's it all about ? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in <unk> on the side of a pearl .
about being a <unk> . what 's it all about ? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in <unk> on the side of a pearl .	cowgirls exist as an image . a fairly common image . the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls <unk> in our culture . therefore , it seems to me , the existence of cowgirls should <unk> . otherwise , they 're being fooled . in the <unk> hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls . two . and both of 'em are <unk> . <unk> is what cowgirls have almost always done in <unk> . our society sure likes to see its <unk> women do tricks . that 's what <unk> call it , you know : <unk> . '
you 're political , then ?	no , ma'am . no way . there 's girls on the rubber rose who are political , but i do n't share their views . i got no <unk> <unk> to <unk> . `` politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it . ''
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth ? it 's not original . it 's something i picked up from the chink .	really ? the chink , huh ? i 've gathered that you sometimes speak with him . what else have you learned from the chink ?
really ? the chink , huh ? i 've gathered that you sometimes speak with him . what else have you learned from the chink ?	learned from the chink ? oh my . ha ha . that 's hard to say . we mostly ... . uh , a lot of his talk is pretty goofy .

what is debbie 's position ?	debbie says that if women are to take charge again , they must do it in the feminine way ; they must n't resort to aggressive and violent <unk> methods . she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men , to love men , set good <unk> for them and guide them <unk> toward the new age . she 's a real dreamer , that <unk> .

you do n't agree with debbie , then ?	i would n't say that . i expect she 's right , ultimately . but i 'm with <unk> when it comes to fighting for what 's mine . i ca n't understand why <unk> is so uptight about the chink ; he could probably teach her a thing or two . <unk> ! that grass <unk> , does n't it ? god knows i love women , but nothing can take the place of a man that fits . still this is <unk> territory and i 'll stand with <unk> and fight any bastards who might deny it . i guess i 've always been a <unk> . look . this scar . only twelve years old and i was <unk> by a silver bullet .

the food and drug administration said wednesday female <unk> <unk> may cause such <unk> <unk> as <unk> , burns and <unk> . although the <unk> judges that the reported <unk> are not sufficient to <unk> removal of these products from the market , they are sufficient to warrant the proposed <unk> label <unk> .	shit o dear , that 's enough to make me <unk> . the nerve of those <unk> . what do they know about female <unk> ? do n't interrupt . here 's my concept . my ranch out west ? it 's a beauty ranch . oh , it 's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes . but it 's a beauty ranch , a place where unhappy women -- <unk> and <unk> , mainly -- can go to lose weight , remove <unk> , change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment . my ranch is named the rubber rose , after the rubber rose <unk> bag , my own invention , and bless its little red <unk> , the most popular <unk> bag in the world . so get this . it 's on the <unk> flight path of the <unk> cranes . the last flock of wild <unk> cranes left in existence . well , these cranes stop off at my little pond -- <unk> lake , it 's called -- twice a year , <unk> and spring , and spend a few days each time , resting up , eating , doing whatever <unk> cranes do . i 've never seen them , understand , but i hear they 're magnificent . very big specimens -- i mean , huge mothers -- and white as snow , to coin a phrase , except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers , and bright red heads . now , <unk> cranes , in case you did n't know it , are noted for their <unk> dance . it 's just the <unk> show in nature . it 's probably the reason why <unk> used to be so popular with old <unk> and <unk> . picture these rare , beautiful , <unk> birds in full dance -- <unk> six feet off the mud , <unk> their backs , <unk> their wings , <unk> low to the ground . <unk> , it 's overwhelming . and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv . right there on the home screen , creation 's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope . with lovely sissy <unk> in the <unk> . in a white gown , red hood attached , and big <unk> <unk> <unk> in black . in a very <unk> imitation of the female <unk> crane , she <unk> over to a large nest in which there sits a can of <unk> <unk> . and a can of <unk> . <unk> , a string quartet is playing <unk> . a <unk> voice is reading a few poetic lines about <unk> and love . are you starting to get it ? does n't it make the hair on your neck stand up and <unk> ? my very goodness gracious ! <unk> , <unk> , erotic and girl <unk> <unk> ; you ca n't top it . i 've hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios , the best <unk> <unk> around . you 're my eternal favorite . princess grace herself could n't be better , not even if she had your personality which she does n't ; anyway , dear , i 'm out of <unk> now and into water colors . ah how <unk> conversation is ! we 're back at the beginning . the exact man i 've wanted you to meet is my artist the <unk> .

purely personal . i believe you might enjoy one another .	but countess ...
but countess ...	now , now . do n't get <unk> . i realize that you 've always avoided all but the most <unk> <unk> with men , and i might add , you 've been wise . <unk> relationships seem to lead only to marriage . for men , marriage is a matter of <unk> <unk> : the male gets his food , bed , laundry , tv , pussy , <unk> and creature <unk> all under one roof , where he does n't have to <unk> his psychic energy thinking about them too much , then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life , which is what existence is all about . but for a woman marriage is surrender .

why , yes , technically . jack <unk> and i came awfully close , but he was afraid of me , i think ...	yes , well , what i 'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is <unk> impossible for a woman to lose her virginity . she ca n't wait too long , you know . now , there 's no reason why you must lose yours . i mean , just <unk> it a bit , that 's all .

that means <unk> , cooper .	i heard it .
i can see why they sent you along .	so if the ship did n't blow up , what happened ?
you still need the rope ? i thought you were one a those <unk> with ice in ya veins .	i 'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it . now step aside , old man .

justin ?	i think i found something ...
time to play <unk> in the can .	do n't start with me , cooper .

the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months . it seems impossible , but in light of the transmission ... i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now .	skipper , do we get hazard pay for this ?
it was like ... nothing was there ... and then justin appeared and the core ... became metal ...	no , he did n't .
no , he did n't .	you were n't there . i saw it .
you were n't there . i saw it .	saw what , mr. cooper ? what did you really see , because what you 're describing is not physically possible ...

he 'll live ... if we ever make it back .	we 'll make it .
of course not . justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it . just one of those things . i swore i 'd never lose another man . i came close today . real close .	`` another man ? '' who ?
i , i tried to go back for him , to save him , but i could n't get to him in time . the fire ... have you ever seen fire in <unk> ? it 's like a liquid , it <unk> over everything . it was like a wave breaking over him , a wave of fire . and then he was gone . i never told anyone until now . but this ship knew , dj . it knows about the <unk> , it knows about <unk> . it knows our secrets . it knows what we 're afraid of . and now you 're going to tell me it 's carbon <unk> .	no .
what is it ?	i 've been listening to the transmission . and i think houston made a mistake in the <unk> .

you wanted to see me , admiral ?	i apologize for the short notice , bill , but we 've had something come up that requires your immediate attention . <unk> ?
incredible ... these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared ... this , this happened ? this is n't some kind of hoax ?	i would n't bring you here on a hoax . houston confirms the <unk> and i.d . codes .

thank you .	do n't thank me , bill . i 'm not doing you any favors .
it 's not that simple . <unk> , play the recording for dr. weir .	<unk> control tried to hail the vessel . this was the only response .

what , justin , what shows you ?	it wo n't stop , it goes on and on and on ...
it wo n't stop , it goes on and on and on ...	what does ?

oh my god oh my god ...	starck !

peters is right , no one 's here .	i do n't know , this place is really dark , i ca n't see a thing ...

the blood came from somewhere , peters ...	there 's no one here , skipper .
okay . i 'm on the bridge .	what you got , peters ?
everything 's been shut down . <unk> power , i guess . green light on the hull , it 's intact .	the science <unk> has power , i 'll see if i can find the crew from here .
i found one .	alive ?
alive ?	frozen .

can anybody hear me ...	skipper ...

where has it been for the last seven years ?	that 's what we 're here to find out .

you 're in the central corridor . it connects the personnel areas to engineering .	peters and i will search the forward decks . justin , take engineering . no <unk> , not on this one , alright ?
i can see that , what 're they for ?	in an emergency , the charges detonate in series , destroying the central section and <unk> the personnel areas from the rest of the ship . that way , if the gravity drive <unk> , the crew could use the <unk> as a lifeboat .
easy , peters , we 're okay , we 're okay . let 's finish the sweep .	captain miller , the <unk> are just ahead .
any survivors ?	negative .
no one ?	they 're empty , dr. weir . moving forward .
it beats dying , mister smith .	dr. weir 's right . get on board the event horizon . i 'll meet you at the airlock .
yes .	one of my men is down . i want to know what happened to him .

it 's complicated ...	how much time do you need ? we have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes . now : what is in the core ?

the event horizon 's computer think 's it 's <unk> .	it 's <unk> ...
it 's <unk> ...	exactly . the ship 's internal clock is off by seven years .
explanation ?	intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time , it 's possible ... black holes make sense on paper , it 's all math , you see , but as to what really happened ... the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality , and like lazarus , returned from the dead .
what the hell is that ? dr. weir ?	i do n't know .
we barely have enough power for life support as it is , if we ca n't stop the drain , we 're not gon na make it .	the core ... !
we do n't get the power back , our air 's gon na go bad .	check the core for radiation . carbon <unk> may be the least of our worries .

if you miss me , you 'll blow out the hull . you 'll die too .	what makes you think i 'll miss ?
weir is dead .	then who the fuck are you ?

i guess we 're about to find out . keep us slow and steady .	yes , sir .
yes , sir .	dr. weir ... !
we 've got some weather .	i noticed . starck , anybody home ?

put it through <unk> . smith , you up for a <unk> ?	love to .
it is now . we 're locked in .	starck , give me a read .

do we have enough time for a <unk> ?	we do n't have time to fart .

but ...	you heard me , smith . peters , are you with me ?
captain miller , you copy ?	i 'm here , smith , how 's the clark ?

... you break all the laws of physics , you think there wo n't be a price ? you already killed the first crew ...	that 's enough !

thank you .	captain , we got a problem .
captain , we got a problem .	now what ?
now what ?	she was right behind me , i turn around , she 's gone . she could be anywhere .
she was right behind me , i turn around , she 's gone . she could be anywhere .	alright . prep the clark for launch . i 'll find her .
skipper ...	what is it , smith ?
what is it , smith ?	i just saw weir , i think he was messing around on the clark .
smith , get out of there ...	come again , skipper ?
come again , skipper ?	one of the explosives is missing from the corridor . i think weir may have put it on the clark .
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock .	no , no , we just got her back together ...
no , no , we just got her back together ...	get out of there now !
where is it , where is it ...	smith ? smith ! fuck !
we 're past the outer marker , we can engage the <unk> drive whenever you 're ready .	justin ?

starck , why are n't you on the bridge ?	i just finished <unk> ...
i just finished <unk> ...	then what are you doing here ? come on , people , let 's go ! and cooper ... put some pants on .
crossing the horizon . <unk> approach angle is fourteen degrees .	come around to <unk> ...
something 's wrong with the <unk> .	radiation interference ?
radiation interference ?	there 's not enough radiation to throw off the scan . i 'm picking up trace life forms , but i ca n't get a lock on the location .
that 's an affirmative .	keep your eyes open .
everybody okay ?	we 're all here .
we 're all here .	okay . let 's find out how much time we just bought .
it tastes bad .	but you can breathe it .
the <unk> <unk> 's completely fried , we 've got no radio , no laser , no <unk> ... no one 's going to be coming to help us .	how much <unk> do we have ?
how much <unk> do we have ?	oxygen is not the problem .
oxygen is not the problem .	carbon <unk> ?

i do n't know , but whatever it is , it 's not the crew .	so where is the rest of the crew ? we 've been over every inch of this ship and all we 've found is blood . dr. weir ? any suggestions ?
what 's the point ? i 'll just get the same thing ...	not acceptable . i want to know what 's causing those readings . if the crew is dead , i want the bodies , i want the crew found .
not acceptable . i want to know what 's causing those readings . if the crew is dead , i want the bodies , i want the crew found .	i can <unk> the scan for <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i can <unk> the scan for <unk> , <unk> <unk> .	do it . dr. weir ...
maybe one of the original crew ?	no . it was someone else .
no . it was someone else .	who ?
who ?	dr. weir , you were right there , you must have heard something , seen something ...
miller ...	what is it , starck ?
what is it , starck ?	... i ran the <unk> with the <unk> filter . the results were <unk> of <unk> origin ...
... i ran the <unk> with the <unk> filter . the results were <unk> of <unk> origin ...	`` ... <unk> of <unk> origin , '' do n't you have anything useful to tell me ?
`` ... <unk> of <unk> origin , '' do n't you have anything useful to tell me ?	i 've got a theory .
go ahead .	there was a another surge in the <unk> readings right before you ... you saw what you saw . we picked up a similar readings right before the <unk> was damaged . what if there were a connection between the two ? the gravity waves , the <unk> , all part of an defensive reaction , like an immune system ...
you 've got to listen ...	to what ? what are you saying ? this ship is alive ?
to what ? what are you saying ? this ship is alive ?	i did n't say that , i said the <unk> readings <unk> to what happened to you , the ship is <unk> to us ...
i did n't say that , i said the <unk> readings <unk> to what happened to you , the ship is <unk> to us ...	we 're hanging on by our fingernails and you 're giving me bullshit stories ...
it 's not bullshit , it 's the only conclusion the data <unk> ...	starck , do you know how crazy that sounds ? it 's impossible .
starck , do you know how crazy that sounds ? it 's impossible .	i know that .
if you knew it was impossible , then why 'd you waste my time ?	i thought you wanted an answer . and that 's the only one i have .
what i want is to survive the next ten hours .	nine hours and twenty-two minutes .
nine hours and twenty-two minutes .	i 'm going outside to work on the clark . and starck ... do n't tell anyone what you just told me . we 've got enough to worry about .
miller , come in ...	what 's going on in there , starck ?
what 's going on in there , starck ?	justin 's in the airlock .
what ?	he 's awake , he 's in the airlock , he 's not wearing a suit .
he 's awake , he 's in the airlock , he 's not wearing a suit .	stay here ! do n't stop working !
i 'm on my way , starck .	you better hurry . he 's engaged the override , we ca n't open the inner door .
tuck yourself into a <unk> position , shut your eyes as tight as you can !	five seconds .
weir ca n't be alive .	whatever was on that bridge was n't weir .
weir activated the drive . he 's sending us to the other place .	we 've got to shut it down , we 've got to ...
blow the fucker up .	blow it up ?
blow it up ?	we blow the corridor . use the <unk> as a lifeboat , separate it from the rest of the ship . we stay put ...
i 'll do it --	no . i 'll be right back .
we 're armed . this fucker 's ready to blow ...	... repeat , we 're armed ...
... repeat , we 're armed ...	miller , he 's back , he was in the tank ...
weir .	he 's dead ...
first time in a <unk> couch ?	yes .
do n't worry about it . he 's hard , but he 's fair . you 're lucky to be shipping out with him . he 's one of the few <unk> in the service with experience in the outer reach .	he 's been past mars ?
he 's been past mars ?	he served on the <unk> .
he served on the <unk> .	was n't that ship destroyed ?
was n't that ship destroyed ?	they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for <unk> . the shuttle 's <unk> tanks <unk> during the rescue , flooded both ships with pure oxygen . there was a spark and both ships were <unk> . the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat . captain miller was able ...
claire ...	dj ! it 's okay . you 're okay . just breathe .
here 's another one . they 're all over the place .	they 're explosive charges .
dr. weir , what 's this the door to ?	you 're at the bridge , ms. peters . you still have n't seen any crew ?
yes , we can see some kind of <unk> . what is that ?	blood . looks like <unk> spray .
blood . looks like <unk> spray .	can you see a body ?
can you see a body ?	there 's no one here .
no . i saw nothing .	i did .
about an hour ago . in medical . i saw my son . he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were ...	is n't it possible that you were <unk> by finding the body on the bridge ?
is n't it possible that you were <unk> by finding the body on the bridge ?	i 've seen bodies before . this is different .
there 's no one in the corridor but us .	not according to the computer .
he 's engaged the override .	can you shut it down ?
yes . yes , justin , we heard it .	keep him talking .
keep him talking .	do you know what it was ?
almost got it .	come on , <unk> , open this door ...
we have to do something , oh god ...	skipper , justin just activated the door . it 's on a thirty second delay ...
you got any coffee ?	it 's cold .
it 's cold .	i do n't care .
hey ...	say this paper represents <unk> , and you want to get from `` point a '' here ... ... to `` point b , '' here . now : what 's the <unk> distance between two points ?
where is she ?	dead ahead , <unk> meters .
jesus , that is one big ugly fat fucker ...	she 's not ugly .
<unk> . crew quarters , bridge , medical and science <unk> , <unk> , what have you . that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area . can we move in closer ?	shit , doc , any closer and we 're gon na need a rubber ...
what the hell is that ?	that 's the core : the gravity drive . the heart of the ship .
the safety circuit 's failed !	we 're losing atmosphere ...
what ?	it still has air and reserve power , we can activate gravity and life support .
i did n't see anything and i do n't have to see anything . this ship is fucked .	thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .
thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .	hey ! you do n't need to be a scientist figure it out ...
i ca n't believe this , i have n't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit . why not mars , cap , mars has women ...	smith 's right . <unk> ? there 's nothing out there . if something happens , we 'll be on our own .
30 hours to <unk> orbit .	all boards are green , everything 's five by five .
you ca n't do that .	the law of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> travel ...
this is u.s. <unk> command vessel lewis and clark , <unk> event horizon , event horizon , do you read ... ? this is the lewis and clark , <unk> ...	<unk> speed ... now . range to target ten thousand meters and closing ... skipper , i got a bad feeling about this ...
if they are , they 're screening their calls .	range <unk> meters and closing .
the scope is lit , it 's right in front of us ...	1000 meters ...
range 500 meters and holding . <unk> is dropping off ...	picking up magnetic interference .
what happened to his eyes ?	explosive <unk> .
explosive <unk> .	<unk> would n't do that .
miller , do you read me , peters --	get them back --
get them back --	i 'm trying , goddammit --
what if the air has gone bad ? we ca n't wear these suits forever .	i do n't think this is a good idea , we do n't even know what happened on that ship ...
<unk> , yes . we ca n't break the law of <unk> , but we can go around it . the ship does n't really move faster than the speed of light ; it creates a <unk> gateway that allows the ship to <unk> `` jump '' from one point in the universe to another , light years away .	how ?
how ?	well , in <unk> 's terms , you use a <unk> magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of <unk> ; these in turn <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> until the <unk> time <unk> becomes <unk> large and you have a <unk> ...
a straight line .	wrong . the <unk> distance between two points ...
the reactor 's still hot . we 've got several small radiation sources , leaks probably . nothing serious .	do they have pressure ?
do they have pressure ?	affirmative . the hull 's intact ... but there 's no gravity and the <unk> units are off line . i 'm showing deep cold . the crew could n't survive unless they were in <unk> .
could it be the crew ? if they were in suspended <unk> , would n't that effect the scan ?	if they were in <unk> , i 'd get a location , but these readings , they 're all over the ship . it does n't make any sense .
what is it ?	ship 's log .
what is it ?	i do n't know . the life readings just went off the scale .
that 's how the gravity drive works , you see : it <unk> the black hole 's <unk> gravitational power to create the gateway . that 's how the event horizon travels faster than light .	i ca n't believe we built this .
why dr. weir , i think you 're in love .	hmmm . claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her . i told her that was n't true , i just knew the event horizon better , that 's all .
hmmm . claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her . i told her that was n't true , i just knew the event horizon better , that 's all .	claire is your wife ?
claire is your wife ?	yes .
yes .	it must be hard , being so far away from her .
it must be hard , being so far away from her .	yes . i miss her . she died . two years now .
yes . i miss her . she died . two years now .	i 'm sorry .
maybe a power <unk> crashed the system ...	no , there 's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind . it 's as if time just ... stopped for seven years .
what are you doing ?	it wants me . i have to go .
in our current environment , dr. weir , <unk> is an asset .	i 'm alright . please .
what is it ?	the forward airlock .
the forward airlock .	miller , smith , cooper , any of you in the airlock ?
justin said something about , `` the dark inside me ... '' what did he mean ?	it means nothing .
i do n't think she 's real big on hate .	you would n't say that , if you could see me .
such a sad face ... you know , sometimes being different is n't a bad thing .	trust me , this ai n't one of those times .
how 'd you know it was me ?	i 'm blind , not deaf . wan na come in ?
i 'm not really dressed for a party .	relax , it 's casual .
relax , it 's casual .	no , i mean ... i 'm a little ... dusty ...
those yours too ?	my <unk> 's . i 'm strictly into stone . i was wondering when you 'd walk by .
we 're going to have to work on your touch .	i like the sound of that .
you know , you <unk> run an ad in the <unk> .	`` <unk> blind chick seeks <unk> ton , <unk> <unk> for deep spiritual relationship . ''
`` <unk> blind chick seeks <unk> ton , <unk> <unk> for deep spiritual relationship . ''	this ai n't permanent . my friend reed 's working on a cure ... i think .
you do n't know what it 's like out there . walking around like some kind of circus freak . people staring , whispering --	i would n't know anything about that .
i would n't know anything about that .	i mean ...
i mean ...	tell me . when you grew up in brooklyn , how many <unk> did you know ? you went your own way then . you did n't listen to people . so why start now ... ?
way to not <unk> it . so when do we leave ?	i 'll schedule the launch . call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .
i can handle the ship . i can even handle mr. blonde ambition . but i do n't know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits . who the hell came up with them ?	victor did .
we can monitor the cloud 's approach and observe the tests from here .	is it safe ?
i can only stay for one drink , ben . i 've got to meet with victor .	would n't want to keep vic waiting .
we need to give you a physical , so we know what got <unk> .	well why did n't you say so ? you want me to lift some <unk> or something ?
you look like an <unk> rock band .	the suit will stretch . you should try it --
the suit will stretch . you should try it --	i would n't be caught dead in that .
he did n't .	oh , he did .
oh , he did .	what did he do to the uniform ? !
he did n't mean it . you know johnny . he 's always been a <unk> --	it 's not him . it 's them . i ca n't live like this .
it 's not him . it 's them . i ca n't live like this .	just give reed a little more time . you know how he works -- <unk> every little step before he takes one --
just give reed a little more time . you know how he works -- <unk> every little step before he takes one --	it 's easy for you to be patient .
it 's easy for you to be patient .	no , it 's not . i thought i was done waiting for reed ... we 're all in this together now , ben .
where is reed ?	victor must 've taken him .
what are you doing here ?	i 'm worried about you .
i 'm worried about you .	about me ? how sweet .
about me ? how sweet .	come on . let me buy you something to eat . looks like you could use the company .
ben , come in .	what is this ? where 's reed ?
what is this ? where 's reed ?	where do you think ? with sue .
what do you want , vic ?	to help you . i 've run every test known to man . and they all yield the same result : the machine is ready .
reed said it 'd be weeks till --	he also said we 'd avoid that storm in space . and we know how that turned out .
he could n't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass . yet another mistake for `` mr . fantastic . ''	and you can ? power it up ?
i 'll be watching over you .	just get back soon , or i start looking for a new groom .
soon as i 'm back , i 'm gon na trade that in for a bigger rock .	i do n't care about rocks , i care about you . you bring him back in one piece , or you can forget being best man .
deb ... it 's me . i need you to step out front .	out front ? you home , baby ? i got a surprise for you .
ben ?	do n't come any closer for a sec . this is gon na be kind of a shock ... you remember when we said `` together forever no matter what '' ?

oh my <unk> what did you ... do to ben ?	deb , it 's me . it 's still me .
what did you wish for , honey ?	i already got it . everything i want .
good thing it ai n't workin ... reed , what are we doing here ? this guy 's <unk> , <unk> science --	this was n't our first stop , in case you forgot nasa . and victor 's not that bad . he 's just a little ... larger than life .
he 's <unk> some of the biggest <unk> of this century .	you 'd never know it .
i ca n't take this .	ben . this is business . just work .
what about his first born ?	ben , the money 's not important . we could save lives .
he knew about nasa . what if he made the call to shut us down --	ben , think about all the people we can help if this works --
ben , think about all the people we can help if this works --	maybe you should think about yourself for once . you always let this guy push you round --
maybe you should think about yourself for once . you always let this guy push you round --	we got what we wanted . that 's enough .
we got what we wanted . that 's enough .	i know , i know . i 'm just worried about what he wants ... speaking of which ...
ca n't do it . i can not do it .	<unk> <unk> , <unk> system engines . its just like the <unk> you flew in --

they crashed it into a wall . a flight <unk> .	i 'm sure he 's <unk> since then .
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do ?	five times .
five times .	i had it at four .
i had it at four .	this makes five .
is n't that your speech ?	he 's made a few changes .
he 's made a few changes .	this is your dream , reed . you should be the one up there .
this is your dream , reed . you should be the one up there .	victor 's better at these things .
the shields on the station should protect us .	should ?
i ai n't done <unk> your flowers , <unk> .	ben . this is serious . turn around .
how long was i out ?	three days . i was worried about you . how are you feeling ?
three days . i was worried about you . how are you feeling ?	solid .
i do n't know . i just keep going over and over the numbers .	reed . even you ca n't <unk> every little thing .
reed . even you ca n't <unk> every little thing .	i should have done more , run more tests --
you go through something like this , makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life .	yeah , you and debbie and perfect --

what ? come on . she 's got a good thing with victor --	i 'm sorry , did that <unk> loosen your screws ?

are you alright ?	i think i need to lie down . bad shrimp .
what the -- !	ben . are you okay ?
ben . are you okay ?	am i okay ? ! you wan na explain that ? !
we had a tough year .	yeah , nine years straight .
you got a <unk> round here ?	if we 're going to identify the source of the <unk> , we need to <unk> your <unk> dna so we can activate <unk> <unk> .
okay . i 've uh , got some questions , from sue . that she thought might be better coming from me ... can you , you know , go to the bathroom ... like normal ...	yeah . you do n't wan na know the details .
yeah . you do n't wan na know the details .	ben , i 'm afraid i 've got to ask --

not unless you want that <unk> stretched up your --	<unk> . we 'll skip that question .
it 's about to be a broken face .	this is n't permanent , johnny . we need to be careful until we 're normal again .
ben --	oh , you remember my name do you ? you happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body ?

hey , two hearts got busted last time . maybe she 's not over it either .	let 's see : you got victor , stud of the year , more coin than god ? or reed , the world 's dumbest smart guy worth less than a <unk> stamp . hmmm , it 's a <unk> .
let 's see : you got victor , stud of the year , more coin than god ? or reed , the world 's dumbest smart guy worth less than a <unk> stamp . hmmm , it 's a <unk> .	put your tiny little mind at ease .

what 's wrong with me ?	i swear to you they 've done everything <unk> possible . the best plastic <unk> in the world , ben . you had the best --
i swear to you they 've done everything <unk> possible . the best plastic <unk> in the world , ben . you had the best --	give me a mirror ...
they said that 's not such a good idea , the shock alone could --	give me the god damn mirror !
hey ! that 's a prototype !	go back to the drawing board .
the machine works . and vic 's gone mister <unk> on us --	really ? with a name like von doom ? never saw that one coming .
no more cracks about how i look .	hey , i 'm mr . sensitivity now . clear the way , wide load coming through .
your tissue , your organs , your entire <unk> structure is changing . every system is still functioning , somehow --	and they 're changing into ...

i do n't really know . a compound <unk> alloy . stronger than <unk> or carbon steel . harder than diamonds --	like the shields reed said would protect us . how long ?
like the shields reed said would protect us . how long ?	at this rate , the infection should be complete in two , maybe three weeks --
at this rate , the infection should be complete in two , maybe three weeks --	what do you mean `` complete '' ?
what do you mean `` complete '' ?	i wish i could tell you . i ca n't pretend to know what we 're dealing with here . i 'll notify the <unk> and --
what ?	the center for disease control . if this thing is contagious --
but ... this disease ... is <unk> ... <unk> ...	that 's terrible news ...
and where do we think we 're going ?	i do n't know if `` we 've '' noticed , but the <unk> runs this side of the <unk> are right outside that window --
you 're hot !	so are you !
so are you !	i mean , you feel a little <unk> .
i mean , you feel a little <unk> .	i 've never felt better in my life . when do you get off work ?
i 've never felt better in my life . when do you get off work ?	my shift ends at four , but i could n't --

you 're on fire !	not this again --
not this again --	no : you 're on fire !
victor 's right . johnny , get to the command center . close the shields .	what about you ?
he 's not <unk> --	ben ! ben !
now what is up with that ?	the cloud has <unk> altered our dna .
the cloud has <unk> altered our dna .	cool . what 'd it do to you guys ?
oh , you <unk> you . better not be my nurse !	ben , are you there ?
this is wrong in so many ways .	you 've been working out .
ben <unk> is a genuine american hero who 's been through a terrible <unk> --	what he 's trying to say is : every team needs a <unk> ...
twenty ? from outside the place looks a lot taller .	oh , it is .
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes ...	this place is <unk> . you got cable ?
this place is <unk> . you got cable ?	... and figure out how to reverse them . let me show you to your rooms .
back it down , johnny !	i can go hotter !
not only could you kill yourself , but you could set fire to earth 's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it .	gotcha . okay . <unk> bad .
is there something about flames ? about <unk> , that you --	what are you trying to say ? just because i dress well and like to dance --
what are you trying to say ? just because i dress well and like to dance --	what ? no . i 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .
what ? no . i 'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .	oh , well that 's easy : i 'm hot . you 're ... well , you 're a little limp . sue 's easy to see through . and ben 's always been a <unk> . why are n't you writing this down ?
he 's right . these costumes are ... missing something . i ca n't put my finger on it --	they 're not costumes .
that 's what i 'm trying to calculate . and it 's not rubber . it 's muscle , <unk> . i seem to have the ability to <unk> the <unk> of my molecular structure and <unk> my <unk> to --	right , whatever , have fun .
you need to control yourself and think before you --	act . here we go again . reed , what if we got these gifts for a reason ? what if we have some , you know ... like , calling ?
act . here we go again . reed , what if we got these gifts for a reason ? what if we have some , you know ... like , calling ?	a higher calling like getting girls and making money ?
johnny . <unk> .	but all these people ...
but all these people ...	now .
the <unk> act as a second skin , <unk> to your individual needs to --	keep the hot side hot , and the cool side cool !
apparently i can disappear .	please tell me you go silent too .
flame on , flame off . flame on , flame off --	johnny .
stop it .	okay , `` mom . ''
what is that thing ?	i think that thing is ben .
wait . you mean there 's chance we could be <unk> ?	grow up , johnny . you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life ?
grow up , johnny . you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life ?	is that a trick question ? c'mon , i ca n't be the only one who thinks this is cool .
you 're really <unk> my style here .	you were at <unk> <unk> . any hotter , you 're approaching <unk> --

sweet .	that 's the temperature of the sun .
uh , we call my sister the invisible girl ... the invisible girl .	girl ... ? !
i 'm driving .	dude . that 's my sister .
you 're gon na pay for that , <unk> . what ? !	you gave us names ? what are you , the `` face '' of the fantastic four now ?
you two need a <unk> .	<unk> started it !
johnny ? did you see ben ?	yeah , for the last time , i hope . i 'm done with this freak show . i 'm moving back to the real world .
yeah , for the last time , i hope . i 'm done with this freak show . i 'm moving back to the real world .	is that what you call it ? `` real '' ?
is that what you call it ? `` real '' ?	at least it beats living in a lab like somebody 's science project .
johnny , slow down . think . you know mom did n't raise us to --	look around , sis ! she 's not here . so you can stop talking to me like i 'm your little boy --
look around , sis ! she 's not here . so you can stop talking to me like i 'm your little boy --	as soon as you stop acting like one . come on , you 're smarter than this . you think those people out there care about you ? you 're just a <unk> to them .
i 'm sorry , sis , for leaving you guys --	no , i 'm sorry , for pushing you out .
what are you doing --	sis . let me take care of you for once .
sis . let me take care of you for once .	but johnny ... you ca n't fly .
if reed 's right , then this little trip will double our stock offering .	and if he 's not ... ?
and if he 's not ... ?	reed 's always right . good thing he does n't always know what he 's got ...
they 're ready for you , sir .	<unk> .
our numbers are through the roof . the <unk> 's tracking at fifty , sixty a share . the bank 's five times <unk> --	it 's not just the money . i could make money in my sleep .
it 's not just the money . i could make money in my sleep .	then what is it ?
then what is it ?	history , leonard . history . everything else is conversation ... how 's the other matter ?
leonard , how 's the feed ?	recording , sir . we see you perfectly .
how 's the <unk> ?	stable . we 're looking at low twenties . it 's a good number , considering the <unk> from --
stable . we 're looking at low twenties . it 's a good number , considering the <unk> from --	reed 's disaster . you know , i <unk> think he did this to me on purpose .
reed 's disaster . you know , i <unk> think he did this to me on purpose .	sir , i 'm sure he would n't put himself --
get me on the am shows , larry king , cover of the journal ... i 've got to do something about this scar . make sure they only shoot my right side .	actually , uh , people seem to think the scar `` <unk> '' you .
actually , uh , people seem to think the scar `` <unk> '' you .	and that 's a good thing ?
you know , maybe you should get some rest --	later . first , i 've got some unfinished business . a deal that needs closing ...
sir , i 've always wondered ... why sue ? you could have any woman in the world but --	that 's why . because i could have any other woman ... you know , when they asked caesar `` why england , '' he said , `` because it 's not mine . ''
make sure you find ben , bring him back here . and keep it quiet . i do n't need this to hit the press .	yes sir . you 've got the mayor at eight , then a <unk> interview with the journal --
yes sir . you 've got the mayor at eight , then a <unk> interview with the journal --	front page ?
front page ?	top left , like you asked . today wall street . tomorrow , who knows ... maybe washington .
you 're , you 've , i mean , how have you bee --	never better .
those solar winds are <unk> , but i <unk> them into my coordinates and --	i was talking about us . working together .
well , uh , based on our history ... you can handle the <unk> , and i 'll focus on the molecular physics . or , uhm , maybe i should take the <unk> , you work the <unk> , since you have some background in <unk> --	right . that 's exactly what i meant .
i , uh , think i remember the number .	it 's been changed .
as far as crew , i was hoping ben could pilot the mission --	well , he 's welcome to ride shotgun , but we already have a pilot on our payroll . you remember my brother johnny ...
material made from <unk> unstable molecules . i 've been working on a formula for this .	great minds think alike .
feeling better ?	yes , thanks .
yes , thanks .	that 's good . that 's uh ... good .
that 's good . that 's uh ... good .	you always had a way with words . i should be getting back .
you 're happy for me and victor .	i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --	which was ?
which was ?	passion .
for science .	you are such a dork , reed ... you never got it and never will unless it 's explained to you in quantum physics .
uh , sue ... ? i ca n't .	what ? what do you mean you --
what ? what do you mean you --	sue ... look at your hands .
it has to be the cloud . it 's <unk> altered our dna .	let 's not jump to conclusions , we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap .
what ?	we need to get past them .
sue . your clothes . lose them .	what ... ? oh .
how come ben ca n't turn it on and off like us ?	that 's what we 're here to find out .
that 's what we 're here to find out .	if it happened to him , then it could ...
it 's not `` <unk> '' per se . you 're bending the light around you with some kind of <unk> force field . that 's what you <unk> on the bridge .	what about you ? you have n't eaten in days . how come you 're never on this side of the <unk> ?
you should be able to bend light around other objects , even people , if you could control your emotional state better --	excuse me ?
i 'm saying , if you had a little more self control , you could locate the trigger . can you remember the exact emotions when --	anger . rage . <unk> .
anger . rage . <unk> .	okay . is there any way to duplicate that feeling ? some memory or ...
okay . is there any way to duplicate that feeling ? some memory or ...	i 'm sure i can come up with something .
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i did n't mean to do that ... you must think that was some kind of <unk> hostility or --	what in the world would give me that idea ?
i mean , you broke up with me , right ?	are you kidding ?
are you kidding ?	no , i distinctly remember : you walked out my door . ergo ...
reed . i was ready for the next step , you were n't , ergo , i walked .	i think it was a little more complicated than --
i think it was a little more complicated than --	i just wanted to share an apartment . what was so complicated about that ?
there were a lot of variables to consider --	no . there were n't . there was you . and me . no variables , no math . it was actually the <unk> thing in the world . but your head got in the way ... like it always does .
what are you doing ?	the plants , from space . their particles are still charged . with the right amount of energy , those <unk> could create the <unk> profile of the cosmic storm .
if we can build a machine to <unk> the storm , we can reverse the <unk> --	and reverse the <unk> --
and reverse the <unk> --	<unk> countless diseases , not just ours .
but we 're the focus , right reed ? reed ... ?	of course . of course .
of course . of course .	and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did n't work out so well .
and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did n't work out so well .	with the right energy , we can stabilize the storm . maybe tie into the city grid ...
reed . how close are we to a cure ?	no way to know . without more tests , experiments .
do n't let victor push you into making a mistake --	he was going to take away all my data , equipment --
he was going to take away all my data , equipment --	better than your life . victor 's not the one who has to get into that thing . we are .
which is why i 'm working twenty hours a day , checking every <unk> --	every <unk> but yourself . you do n't eat , sleep . you ca n't live in your head like --
every <unk> but yourself . you do n't eat , sleep . you ca n't live in your head like --	i 'm not the only one in there . i got you , vic , ben , johnny , all <unk> around in there .
i could get ben to tap into the baxter 's main power to generate enough <unk> --	reed . shh . just be quiet . and look up .
remember our first date here ... ? god , i was so nervous .	you were ?
you were ?	of course i was . i 'd read all your papers on <unk> . some of them two times just so i 'd have something to say to you .
you know , i <unk> the <unk> ten bucks to keep it open late ?	i gave him twenty .
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you ... speak his mind . one who was n't afraid to tell you what he wanted .	i did . i did , reed ... but i wanted you to be that man .
when i walked out , i waited ten minutes outside your door . ten . waiting for you to come find me .	why did n't you say something ?
why did n't you say something ?	that would have kinda defeated the purpose . and reed ... i 'm saying it now .
i can ... make it work .	reed , stop , you need to rest your --
reed , stop , you need to rest your --	the power ... i need ... more power ... to control ... the storm --
the power ... i need ... more power ... to control ... the storm --	you need a doctor .
sue , i need some of that anger , rage , <unk> --	i 'm sure i can come up with something .
i found a broken gasket , from space --	a gasket ? reed , we 're at a party .
but dreams do n't pay the bills , do they ? same old reed , the hopeless <unk> . still reaching for the stars , with the world on your back .	you remember in school we talked about working together . that 's what i was about to explain ...
this is n't going to be a problem , is it ?	not at all .
you back this mission , and i 'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --	the number 's seventy-five . and it 's applications and <unk> .
funny how things turn out , is n't it ?	hilarious .
got it . so take a walk , ben ... i 'm going to borrow susan for a second .	sure .
we 've got minutes until it hits , not hours ... victor , that storm 's deadly -- the radiation 's lethal . we need to abort .	get a grip . reed . we did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields ...
get a grip . reed . we did n't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields ...	ben 's still out there --
ben 's still out there --	so reel him in . but we came here to do a job . so let 's do it . quickly .
come on , ben , come on ...	reed , we 're running out of time .
not until ben is back inside !	it 's too late for him , and soon it 'll be too late for all of us .
just a little banged up . a couple <unk> . why ?	ben did this .
ben did this .	ben did this ?
ben did this ?	he 's had some kind of ... reaction to exposure from the cloud . and he 's not the only one .
i 'm starting to wonder the same thing ... how much do you know about what happened to you ?	not much . we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .
did n't go as planned ? it was a <unk> . you ruined the lives of four people --	i ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort --
i ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort --	abort ? reed , i put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and i will not let you make me look like a fool --
abort ? reed , i put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and i will not let you make me look like a fool --	victor , if we could understand what happened to us --
victor , if we could understand what happened to us --	i do n't want to understand it . this is n't one of your science projects . i just want to fix it . fast !
what are you doing here ?	what i should have done a long time ago . applications and <unk> , reed . this all belongs to me .
but i 'm not done with the machine --	which is precisely the point . analysis is over . it 's time for action . my men could have <unk> this by now .
it 's just business .	i think you both know my director of genetic research , susan storm .
surprised i agreed to reed 's proposal ?	i understand the business reasons .
i understand the business reasons .	well , when you 're looking at your future , it never hurts to find <unk> about the past .
it 's been a good two years , victor ... the company 's accomplished so much .	right , of course , the company ... but you see , i 've come to realize all the <unk> in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
right , of course , the company ... but you see , i 've come to realize all the <unk> in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --	uh , victor , i hope i have n't done something to make you think ...
uh , victor , i hope i have n't done something to make you think ...	sue , i 've lived my life <unk> of taking big steps . and this is the biggest step yet . if it helps , think of this as a promotion . a merger of sorts ... four little words that can change our lives ...
what are you doing ?	raising the shields .
raising the shields .	you ca n't leave them out there .
what 's going on ?	victor , are you feeling alright ?
victor , i 'm sorry i --	just find him .
victor , your scar --	i told you , i 'm fine . it 's you i 'm worried about .
i told you , i 'm fine . it 's you i 'm worried about .	i 'm sorry i did n't get a chance to --
i 'm sorry i did n't get a chance to --	please , no apologies . i 've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my <unk> . you 'll have <unk> clock care .
you said it was urgent .	it is . there 's something we need to talk about . something i need to ask you ...
victor , wait , slow down a second . i want you to know i appreciate everything you 've done for me , but i just do n't --	susan . what are you doing ?
he 's working round the clock . but the data needs to be tested , analyzed before --	same old reed . all analysis , no action . was n't that the problem with you two ?
if these molecules are n't stable , they could make us worse , maybe even kill us .	then why is reed dragging his feet ? maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass ... it 's ironic , is n't it ? you 're finally the perfect woman for him ... because you 're his science project .
please do n't make this personal --	oh , i think you already have .
oh , i think you already have .	victor , we ca n't do anything until the research is ready .
<unk> me .	i know it ca n't be easy . life has n't changed that much for reed , sue and johnny . at least they can go out in public . but for you ? people staring . whispering behind your back ...
i know it ca n't be easy . life has n't changed that much for reed , sue and johnny . at least they can go out in public . but for you ? people staring . whispering behind your back ...	if you 're trying to cheer me up you 're doing a helluva job --
if you 're trying to cheer me up you 're doing a helluva job --	i 'm just saying , i know what it 's like to lose something you love . to see it slip away , and know it 's never coming back .
reed 's gon na fix me up --	for your sake i hope you 're right . i 'm sorry if that sounds a little <unk> .
for your sake i hope you 're right . i 'm sorry if that sounds a little <unk> .	<unk> ... ?
brad , can i talk to you a minute ?	arnold . what 's happening ?
brad , i really fuckin ' hate <unk> 's , man . ever since they started in with the chicken , everything went <unk> .	you want to work at carl 's ?
you want to work at carl 's ?	oh , man , if you could swing something there , i 'd do anything for you . i want to work with you guys .
oh , man , if you could swing something there , i 'd do anything for you . i want to work with you guys .	i can probably get you in there . just let me talk to dennis taylor .
i can probably get you in there . just let me talk to dennis taylor .	all right ! !
were those flowers really for me , brad ?	of course .
of course .	how much did they cost ?
how much did they cost ?	do n't worry about it .
what 's there to do at the point ? god , lisa , we 've been going together almost two years , and ...	brad . i do n't want to have to use sex as a tool .
brad . i do n't want to have to use sex as a tool .	tool ? tool for what ? we 've been going together almost two years !
tool ? tool for what ? we 've been going together almost two years !	i do n't want to talk about it here , brad .
man , i do n't even want to see those guys from carl 's again .	if you 'd apologize i think dennis would take you back .
if you 'd apologize i think dennis would take you back .	apologize to that wimp ? no way . fuck dennis taylor .
i 'm just glad we 're still together , lisa , because i need you this year .	look , brad , i 've been trying to think of a way to tell you this . we 're almost out of high school , this is our last year . i think we owe it to ourselves to be free , and meet some new people . then , if we get back together , we 'll know it 's the right thing .
something happened to them , mon .	come on , <unk> . why do n't you just put your shirts back on ? see the sign ?

you see , all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that do n't rely on heat seeking ...	um , excuse me , sir , but the situation 's more complicated than that . the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has .
no , it <unk> <unk> . that 's why we must find the nest . if we do n't , dozens will be born , each one capable of laying eggs of its own . very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population .	so after we kill the creature we 'll begin a search for the nest .

you gave them the tape ?	no , it 's still in my tent . it 's ... oh my god , she took it .

so , you are william 's wild young neighbor ? or should i say , <unk> ' ; william claims you as a member of his family . i have heard so many <unk> tales about you , and i understand , that except for you , this <unk> ' is quite <unk> .	george , i 'm sorry .

the word <unk> ' finds its source in <unk> , which is latin meaning <unk> ' or <unk> ' .	or , <unk> ' .
or , <unk> ' .	in the <unk> , george , every movement is significant , like the <unk> of cranes ...

it 's the <unk> land on earth .	is it ? well , i 'm scared of what we 've become in our freedom .
is it ? well , i 'm scared of what we 've become in our freedom .	well , we must be who we must be ...
and to think i am teaching you to become one of them ...	what else should i become ? there 's no difference between virginia and england . i must be educated if i 'm to take my place in society . my father could n't afford to send me to england for school -- he made a <unk> of our fortunes . everyone laughs at me .
i do n't laugh at you , george . i like you . i like you because you will never , ever make it as an <unk> ... and that 's because you 're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings .	i think i will disappoint you .

that why harry came over last night ? see if you could help him get martin in his movie ?	harry 's dreaming of a <unk> dollar production he 'll never get off the ground with a star he 'll never sign . with or without my help .
harry 's dreaming of a <unk> dollar production he 'll never get off the ground with a star he 'll never sign . with or without my help .	harry told me martin loves it , he flipped .
harry told me martin loves it , he flipped .	yeah , well martin is known for his <unk> . he <unk> over a script , and when the time comes to make a deal , he <unk> out .

i do n't want to act in it , i want to produce it with harry . especially if i help him get martin .	sounds fair .
sounds fair .	what do you get out of it ?
that why you came over here , to ask me that ?	i want to know .
i want to know .	why does anyone want to be in movies ?
why does anyone want to be in movies ?	yesterday , you were a loan shark .
i was never much into it . all that bullshit having to do with respect . it 's bad enough having to treat those guys like they 're your heroes , having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think 's real funny .	and you think the movie business is any different ?
and you think the movie business is any different ?	yeah well ... i like movies . i figure if i help harry make one , i 'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money . that does n't sound too hard . i was in the money business and i get ideas all the time .
this thing 's actually accurate . i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset ...	you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant .
well actually , martin the movie we came to talk about is mr. lovejoy .	yeah . we understand you read the script and like it ... a lot .
a locker at the airport ? jesus christ , harry . tell me you 're not really that stupid .	the guy 's setting you up . you pulled out of their freaks deal so he 's paying you back .
that was martin . he wants to have lunch tomorrow . that is , if you can make it .	depends , who pays ?
depends , who pays ?	definitely not martin . movie stars never pick up the check . they have no idea what things cost . most of them do n't know their zip code and a lot do n't even know their own phone number .
how 'd you meet martin anyway ?	not unlike the way <unk> met him . except it was a wrap party . why ?
not unlike the way <unk> met him . except it was a wrap party . why ?	i do n't know , i 'm just havin ' some trouble seeing you two together .

you do n't like martin much , do you ?	oh , i like him . i just think he 's ... short . i mean , he 's a good actor and all , but i 'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in marty .
oh , i like him . i just think he 's ... short . i mean , he 's a good actor and all , but i 'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in marty .	for starters , marty was n't martin back then .
so what about your story . you thought of a title yet ?	how 'bout get shorty ? except that is n't a movie . that 's real life .
how 'bout get shorty ? except that is n't a movie . that 's real life .	how 'bout chili 's hollywood adventure .
how 'bout chili 's hollywood adventure .	that 's a different story . i 'm still working on that one , you know , getting the visual fabric just right . although i 've added to it .
yeah ?	yeah . there 's a girl in it now .
yeah . there 's a girl in it now .	really .
i think you could be an actor . i know you 're acting sometimes , but you do n't show it .	you thought i was faking ?
you thought i was faking ?	no . i do n't mean that . i just meant in general .
no . i do n't mean that . i just meant in general .	oh .
you do n't mean a movie star ? more like a character actor ?	<unk> . let 's talk about it tomorrow .
i mean i could see myself in movies robert de <unk> had been in . or i could maybe do an al <unk> movie , play a hard-on . but i could n't see myself in ones , like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby . they do n't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -�	hey , chili ? look at me .
harry ... my god ...	what happened ?
what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway ?	<unk> , but it does n't matter . martin wo n't order from the menu .
why not ?	because a movie star can never order straight from the menu . they have to think of something they have to have that is n't on the menu .
harry , what 're you doing ? you 're supposed to be in the hospital .	yeah , harry , you look like you belong in one of your horror movies .
you sure ?	he 's doing the same thing you did to him , playing <unk> on tv .
he 's doing the same thing you did to him , playing <unk> on tv .	it 's not dave . it 's a movie .
it 's not dave . it 's a movie .	are you going down ?
are you going down ?	i do n't know .
i do n't know .	you 're as bad as harry ...
you 're as bad as harry ...	i 'll go . i 'll go .
you okay ?	guy 's got a fucking pink toilet , for christ 's sake .
karen ! what the fuck are you doing ? !	oh , shit ... i 'm sorry ... i thought that was ... i 'm so sorry ...
were you scared up there ?	you bet .
you bet .	you do n't act like it ?
you do n't act like it ?	i was scared then , not now . how long you want me to be scared ?
i 'll be right back .	go get your stuff .
what took you so long ?	could n't find my toothbrush .
they 're closing the <unk> . you know , theater down on <unk> ?	yeah , the guy owes <unk> a few g 's .
yeah , the guy owes <unk> a few g 's .	what i 'm thinkin ' is maybe <unk> could buy it .
<unk> could buy it , i could run it for him . show some <unk> films .	what 's <unk> gon na want with an old place , shows old movies people do n't care about no more . outside of maybe <unk> ' it into a porno house , i do n't think he 's gon na give much of a fuck . and you already got a job .
you sure it was ray bones took the coat ?	that 's what the guy said .
that 's what the guy said .	tomorrow , i see on the tv weather , it 's gon na be nice and warm . you wo n't need the coat .
hey , chili . get your coat , but do n't piss the guy off , okay ? it could get complicated and we 'd have to call <unk> to straighten it out . then <unk> gets pissed for wasting his time and we do n't need that .	do n't worry about it . i wo n't say any more than i have to , if that .
no , i said i 'm never goin ' to bed . there 's a difference . see , the article says most people die in their beds . i figure long as i stay outta bed , i 'm safe .	that 's the dumbest thing i ever heard . where do you sleep ?
that 's the dumbest thing i ever heard . where do you sleep ?	in an <unk> . or i go to a coffee shop , sleep there . sit in a booth , pull my hat down .
i told you not to -�	do n't say a fuckin ' word .
i hate to say i told you , but i did . i told you do n't start nothing with him that time .	you said do n't say nothing and i did n't .
you said do n't say nothing and i did n't .	no , you just broke his fuckin ' nose instead .
no , you just broke his fuckin ' nose instead .	you gon na start that again ? you 're just like him , all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin ' thing .
you gon na start that again ? you 're just like him , all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin ' thing .	all i know is he came by the barber shop , all fuckin ' <unk> , wanting to know where you were staying in vegas . i told him i do n't know . i still do n't .
all i know is he came by the barber shop , all fuckin ' <unk> , wanting to know where you were staying in vegas . i told him i do n't know . i still do n't .	how 'd he know i was in vegas ? you tell him ?
how 'd he know i was in vegas ? you tell him ?	he already knew it .

how you gon na do that ? you do n't know shit about making movies .	i do n't think the producer has to do much , outside of maybe knowing a writer .
i do n't think the producer has to do much , outside of maybe knowing a writer .	hey , <unk> ? i think you 're fulla shit .
yeah , but whose point of view ?	whatta you mean , whose point of view ; the audience 's point of view .
whatta you mean , whose point of view ; the audience 's point of view .	get down here . i wan na talk to you . come on ... right now ... she 's gon na talk to martin ?
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gon na distance us from the emotion of the scene .	what <unk> ' ? girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick .
what <unk> ' ? girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick .	she 's scared ! fear is an emotion ! look , kid , if you remember anything from your time working with harry <unk> , let it be the three key words to <unk> .

guess i 'll just keep working .	what 're you crazy ?
what 're you crazy ?	i like my job .
light in those <unk> ai n't so good .	i 'm telling you , i saw somebody . i do n't know who it was . but i saw somebody .
maybe that is his boat .	gim me a break .
fifty million dollars . fifty million . we gon na let this guy just take it from us ? one guy ?	so we kill him ?
so we kill him ?	i 'm saying we got ta do whatever we got ta do to preserve our interest .
one guy is n't gon na be so stupid .	maybe he is n't alone .
pretty handy with that <unk> gun , epps . you raised on a farm ?	seen a <unk> movies .
smokes ?	oh yeah .
i 'm no doctor . but i 'd say he 's in a coma .	a what ?
a what ?	i do n't know what else you 'd call it . he 's breathing on his own , but his pupils are completely blown out . he 's totally <unk> to pain . what happened up there ?
i do n't know what else you 'd call it . he 's breathing on his own , but his pupils are completely blown out . he 's totally <unk> to pain . what happened up there ?	i heard a scream . when i got there i found him on the floor . he was having some kind of <unk> . i did n't see anybody else .
other than the obvious , there 's nothing wrong with him that i can see , not on the outside .	then what the hell happened to him ?
try wednesday .	right . wednesday .
did you ?	hell no . you think i 'm crazy ?
what say , epps ? you up for some <unk> <unk> ?	why not ?
dodge . dodge .	what ?
what ?	get up .
get up .	yeah , yeah .
you are n't jealous , are you dodge ?	are you kidding me ? jealous ? epps ? gim me a break .
what the hell would a <unk> be doing up here ? it 's way out of the lanes . there 's not a port for 800 miles .	<unk> maybe .
yeah , from one side of the harbor to the other . but we got half the <unk> sea and the whole <unk> gulf to drag her over .	you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage ? the <unk> alone could go for a few million .
you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage ? the <unk> alone could go for a few million .	if you get it back in one piece .
if you get it back in one piece .	it 's a risk i 'm willing to take .
it 's a bloody <unk> hazard . one boat ca n't control a ship that size .	the damn thing 's been floating around for god knows how long and it has n't hit anything yet . so we take it easy . a little of the old push pull .
with a little extra fuel , weather <unk> , we should make <unk> in five days without another stop .	sounds reasonable .
mother fucker !	what is it ?
what is it ?	threw a <unk> blade .
the number one <unk> 's pretty well <unk> . number two runs , but it 's way <unk> .	how long to fix ?
how long to fix ?	hard to say . i got ta get in there and have a look . at least a couple days . depending .
what 's this ?	<unk> <unk> 's shot .
<unk> <unk> 's shot .	i thought you said it was just a blade .
i thought you said it was just a blade .	metal 's <unk> . got ta replace the whole deal .
metal 's <unk> . got ta replace the whole deal .	how much longer 's that gon na take ?
how much longer 's that gon na take ?	like i always say --
like i always say --	i know i know , two ways to do anything --
i know i know , two ways to do anything --	the right way and the wrong way .
the right way and the wrong way .	but how long ?
but how long ?	hard to say .
hard to say .	we got ta get outa here , dodge . a storm blows up and we 're history .
we got ta get outa here , dodge . a storm blows up and we 're history .	i 'm telling you , you do n't want to be running that fan like it is .
i 'm telling you , you do n't want to be running that fan like it is .	what about running number two by itself ?
what about running number two by itself ?	it 's a full <unk> horses down . we could n't drag that boat down hill on ice with it .
it 's a full <unk> horses down . we could n't drag that boat down hill on ice with it .	how long , then ?
how long , then ?	i got ta pull the blades and <unk> everything in a new <unk> -- .
i got ta pull the blades and <unk> everything in a new <unk> -- .	how long ?
how long ?	three , four days .
three , four days .	goddamit , dodge .
goddamit , dodge .	what do you want me to tell you , that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened ? ca n't do it , skipper .
obviously it 's some kind of screw up . the shipping records are n't a hundred percent accurate .	man , it gives me the creeps . we got no business <unk> a ship that size anyway . i say we fix the <unk> and hit the highway .
went aboard .	she take a radio ?
it 's a hell of a lot of money .	what , you think there 's something funny about it ?
what , you think there 's something funny about it ?	a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard , <unk> ? and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it ?
did n't happen yesterday , i 'll tell you that . torn parts <unk> bad as the rest of the boat .	then it happened before they <unk> her .
or somebody stopped them .	either way , they must 've had a pretty good reason .
so what 're we gon na do . that 's the big question , right ?	a salvage claim to a vessel 's cargo 's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself . it 's ours .
a salvage claim to a vessel 's cargo 's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself . it 's ours .	then we 're rich . we 're damn , filthy stinking rich .
then we 're rich . we 're damn , filthy stinking rich .	it looks like it .
you got ta be kidding ? what the hell we need that tub for , we got fifty million bucks ?	so we get a little more for the boat . besides , the gold 'll be safer where it is .
yeah , yeah . i 'm on it .	the sooner we get under way , the sooner we are to spending what 's ours .
i 'm buyin ' me a nice <unk> . spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the <unk> .	how about you epps ?
<unk> 's all any of you 're gon na be doing if we do n't get this boat running .	yeah , yeah .
sounds like the hull .	warm water current maybe , making the metal expand .
if somebody 's aboard her already , she ai n't ours . she 's theirs .	bullshit . that boat has n't made steam for fifty years . we found her . she 's ours .
bullshit . that boat has n't made steam for fifty years . we found her . she 's ours .	not in the eyes of the law .
i say fuck the motherfucker . we 're a professional salvage crew going about our business . what 's some <unk> doing way out here by himself anyway ?	and what do you propose ? that we knock this guy off ?
and what do you propose ? that we knock this guy off ?	why not ? why the fuck not ?
what if that fucker finds it before we 're ready to go ?	we 'll stand a watch . four on , eight off . low man first .
if he 's reasonable , maybe we can make some kind of deal . if not . we 'll have to <unk> our options .	yeah , reconsider fucking his shit up .
bodies 're too fresh .	fresh ai n't the first word that comes to mind .
damn <unk> is what it is .	could be meant as a warning .
that 'd be my guess .	so whoever did this might still be around .
ca n't you use something else ?	i might be able to find something on the ship . but it 's gon na take time .
i might be able to find something on the ship . but it 's gon na take time .	do what you need to do . just do it fast .
do what you need to do . just do it fast .	right .
dodge to murphy .	murphy .
murphy .	you better get down here quick , skipper . i 'm on `` c '' deck . cabin 400 .
you better get down here quick , skipper . i 'm on `` c '' deck . cabin 400 .	what is it ?
what is it ?	i think you better see this for yourself .
it was a man 's voice . repeating some sort of children 's rhyme . i do n't know , it did n't make any sense . you did n't hear it ?	not me .
on a passenger ship in <unk> ?	if they knew what they were carrying .
so . i got a question . just from a , you know , purely technical <unk> . we call the <unk> . <unk> shows up . what exactly is the plan ?	how do you mean ?
how do you mean ?	well , they 're gon na be asking a lot of questions . about us . about those bodies . about the gold . seems like we oughta be prepared is all .
well , they 're gon na be asking a lot of questions . about us . about those bodies . about the gold . seems like we oughta be prepared is all .	i guess the best strategy 's just to tell them the truth .
i guess the best strategy 's just to tell them the truth .	yeah , well . the truth is one thing . when there 's more than a few hundred million dollars involved , that 's a whole new deal .
yeah , well . the truth is one thing . when there 's more than a few hundred million dollars involved , that 's a whole new deal .	what do you propose ?
what do you propose ?	for starters , getting that gold off the ship . what they do n't know about is n't gon na bother them .
there 's no way we 're gon na hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the <unk> here . besides , it 'll be safer where it is .	with all due respect , skipper . part of that up there 's mine . i 'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it .
just what the hell do you think you 're doing ? !	i do n't know what you 're talking about ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about ?	i think you know .
i think you know .	maybe you can tell me then .
the radio !	the radio . oh , yeah , the radio .
take it easy , willya ? what about the radio ? !	you smashed it !
you smashed it !	what ? !
what ? !	do n't lie to me !
do n't lie to me !	what the fuck -- ?
what the fuck -- ?	you did n't want us calling anybody . too liable to ruin your big payday .
you did n't want us calling anybody . too liable to ruin your big payday .	i did n't touch the fucking radio .
i did n't touch the fucking radio ! ever occur to you there 's somebody else on that boat , skipper ?	<unk> enough for you .
<unk> enough for you .	look , i did n't touch it . alright ?
yeah .	you better get down here right now ! we 're taking water ! big time !
what the hell happened !	<unk> chamber on number two must 've blown ! took out part of the hull !
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants .	if money can buy what he wants .
if money can buy what he wants .	i do n't figure there 's much i want money ca n't buy .
i do n't figure there 's much i want money ca n't buy .	then you 're a lucky man .
we 'll stand the watch on deck tonight . you 're up first .	right .
tomorrow we 'll see if we ca n't find some line and tackle . use some of those bodies below decks for bait .	there 's a charming thought .
you 're late .	sorry .
sorry .	do n't fall asleep .
do n't fall asleep .	right .
what 's slow ?	maybe twenty gallons an hour .
morning everybody .	show your <unk> to that <unk> last night , did you epps ?
show your <unk> to that <unk> last night , did you epps ?	showed him a hell of a lot more than that .
showed him a hell of a lot more than that .	i bet you did .
could be a fishing boat .	too big . more like a <unk> .
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass .	he 'd let you off at the nearest port , that 's for sure .
you mean , before she sank .	cargo like this could make a crew think twice .
then why did n't they take it .	probably did n't have time .
two hundred twenty two <unk> of solid gold .	that 's what i call a payday .
that 's what i call a payday .	hell yeah .
that 's a good thing ?	hell , yeah . i like it cold . <unk> the better .
what 'd he look like ?	maybe six feet . <unk> . i did n't get a good look . he was far away . but i saw him . i saw him as sure as you 're standing there .
coffee .	you 're a pal .
stay away . or else .	because of the gold .
any <unk> ?	no .
no .	headache , <unk> , lights ?
headache , <unk> , lights ?	lights ?
lights ?	sudden <unk> of light .
sudden <unk> of light .	i feel fine .
i do n't even want to know what that 's gon na taste like now .	better than starving to death .
you okay ?	yeah . fine . i just thought i heard something is all .
yeah . fine . i just thought i heard something is all .	what ?
what ?	nothing . let 's get outa here .
i ca n't believe you . dodge 's dead and all you can think about is <unk> in your share .	i did n't sign up to go home empty handed . and i sure ai n't gon na roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this .
candy ?	it 's my pen name .
go on .	salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks . at least . who knows , could be more . could be a lot more . what i 'm proposing is ... we split it four ways .
the law 's on our side . if they want to challenge it , let them try .	they must 've <unk> it . nobody just lets a ship float away .
coffee ?	yeah . thanks .
what 'd you find up there ?	some charts . a crew <unk> . looks like her last voyage was january <unk> . the question is where the hell 's she been since .
some charts . a crew <unk> . looks like her last voyage was january <unk> . the question is where the hell 's she been since .	she was sailing up north , right ?
she was sailing up north , right ?	her destination was <unk> , yeah .
her destination was <unk> , yeah .	well , suppose she got a little further north than she should have . got stuck in the ice . the passengers and crew <unk> . she froze into the ice pack , which moved further north , where it froze in solid . they write it off . fifty years later , the whole global warming thing happens . the ice <unk> , she gets loose and <unk> around til somebody runs into her .
ever heard of the mary <unk> ?	nope .
nope .	she was a <unk> <unk> boat sailing out of new york in <unk> . one day she was <unk> off the coast of <unk> by a merchant vessel , the <unk> <unk> . as the crew of the <unk> <unk> got closer , they discovered that no one was at the <unk> of the mary <unk> . on boarding , they found her completely deserted . the captain , his wife , their daughter , and the entire crew , all gone . the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble . the table was even set for dinner . and in the nine days after the last entry , she sailed <unk> miles without anyone aboard .
she was a <unk> <unk> boat sailing out of new york in <unk> . one day she was <unk> off the coast of <unk> by a merchant vessel , the <unk> <unk> . as the crew of the <unk> <unk> got closer , they discovered that no one was at the <unk> of the mary <unk> . on boarding , they found her completely deserted . the captain , his wife , their daughter , and the entire crew , all gone . the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble . the table was even set for dinner . and in the nine days after the last entry , she sailed <unk> miles without anyone aboard .	so what did happen ?
so what did happen ?	nobody knows . there 've been a lot of theories , of course . but we 'll never really know for sure .
nobody knows . there 've been a lot of theories , of course . but we 'll never really know for sure .	you think she 's sailing without a crew ?
i think we 'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current .	you 're more practical than superstitious .
you 're more practical than superstitious .	only way to be .
maybe they did n't want it back . maybe the whole fat deal was insured .	maybe . but there 's always somebody whose interest 's at stake .
why not call for help ?	for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this .
take it easy , you 'll live longer .	did you see him ?
did you see him ?	who ?
who ?	the guy . he just came this way .
the guy . he just came this way .	what guy ?
what guy ?	there 's somebody else on this boat .
there 's somebody else on this boat .	what ? what the hell 're you talking about .
what ? what the hell 're you talking about .	i saw him . just a minute ago . some guy .
i saw him . just a minute ago . some guy .	are you sure ?
are you sure ?	of course i 'm sure . i saw him .
of course i 'm sure . i saw him .	you sure it was n't me ?
you sure it was n't me ?	it was n't you . it was somebody else . there 's somebody else aboard .
so , we find this guy and make a deal with him .	we do n't exactly have the best <unk> position .
guess that 'd be me . again .	dodge , get on that <unk> . i do n't care if you do n't sleep for a week . the sooner you 're done , the sooner we can get out of here . how 's the food situation ?
no cowboy shit up there , understand ?	no cowboy shit . right .
got your light ?	yup .
murphy to epps .	epps .
epps .	you just shoot at something ?
you just shoot at something ?	yeah . just a bird . just a stupid bird .
just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio .	greer ?
greer ?	i do n't know . no . not greer . somebody .
he needs a doctor .	i 'll call us in . dodge , see how many signal <unk> you can <unk> up . keep an eye on him .
how 's he doing ?	same . any luck ?
same . any luck ?	no . i 'll try again later .
they 're dead in the water that morning . four hours later the captain 's relieved of his command . and that evening they issue a general <unk> .	possibly false . hence the <unk> record of being lost at sea . i do n't think <unk> 's out of the question here .
you 're saying they <unk> for the gold ?	if they were close enough to shore , they probably figured they could get away in the <unk> .
if they were close enough to shore , they probably figured they could get away in the <unk> .	only something must 've gone wrong .
the ah ... the radio 's out .	what ?
what ?	somebody took it out of commission last night .
smashed it up pretty bad .	but , who -- ?
`` the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill . ''	february first .
february first .	the same day she supposedly went down .
the same day she supposedly went down .	must not 've been the captain 's entry . he was probably out of the picture by then .
`` their lacking <unk> has undoubtedly caused the <unk> . distress calls have been made . ''	<unk> ? with what ?
<unk> ? with what ?	the page 's missing . then their <unk> was real .
the page 's missing . then their <unk> was real .	but where 's the damage ?
but where 's the damage ?	maybe the other ship took the worst of it .
maybe the other ship took the worst of it .	if it was a ship she hit .
it 's a good bet they 'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too .	let 'em ask . this ship 's legally ours now .
it 's not gon na hold us .	does n't matter .
hey .	hey .
hey .	could n't sleep .
could n't sleep .	wish i could say the same .
what do you think happened on this boat ?	i guess that 's the sixty four thousand dollar question , is n't it ?
i guess that 's the sixty four thousand dollar question , is n't it ?	the what ?
the what ?	never mind . before your time . i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts . the usual stuff that happens when people <unk> on a fortune . equal parts greed and paranoia , usually <unk> in homicide . what happened after that is anybody 's guess . but , judging by our greek friends down below , it does n't look like the last time .
never mind . before your time . i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts . the usual stuff that happens when people <unk> on a fortune . equal parts greed and paranoia , usually <unk> in homicide . what happened after that is anybody 's guess . but , judging by our greek friends down below , it does n't look like the last time .	are we smart enough to avoid that ?
are we smart enough to avoid that ?	i do n't know , are we ?
when you found me yesterday , at the pool . i 'd seen ... something . someone .	not our mystery guest again .
not our mystery guest again .	no . someone else . a girl . i 'm not sure she was ... real .
what , like some kind of ghost ?	i do n't know what else you 'd call her . one second she was there , the next she was gone .
maybe <unk> is the wrong word . it was more than that . as though they were showing me .	showing you what ?
showing you what ?	what happened .
what happened .	maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those <unk> .
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those <unk> .	no . i think they are , were , just passengers . innocent victims .
no . i think they are , were , just passengers . innocent victims .	victims of what ?
victims of what ?	something bad happened here , murphy .
something bad happened here , murphy .	that much i think we 've already established .
that much i think we 've already established .	more than just a <unk> . more than just the gold .
she said the ship was evil . that we had to leave right away . that if we did n't , we might never leave .	what 's that supposed to mean ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?	i do n't know .
why you ? how come the rest of us have n't seen these people ?	just lucky i guess .
murphy to epps .	epps , over .
epps , over .	either of you seen dodge ?
nope .	he 's not on deck and i ca n't raise him on the radio .
epps ? you there ?	right here .
what do we do with him ?	leave him till we can get some help . from now on , nobody comes down here .
what do you think ?	could be a stroke . who knows ? the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves . `` like wild dogs . ''
could be a stroke . who knows ? the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves . `` like wild dogs . ''	over the gold .
over the gold .	maybe it was more than that .
they went crazy .	crazy with greed . not crazy . not like him .
hard to say which is worse , staying here or taking our chances in open water .	if the weather holds it might not be so bad .
if the weather holds it might not be so bad .	it 's not the weather i 'm worried about . the wrong current could drag us as far as the <unk> before we come across another boat .
what happened ?	we hit land .
we hit land .	what ?
what ?	we 're in an island chain . it 's only a matter of time before we hit another one .
we 're in an island chain . it 's only a matter of time before we hit another one .	greer 's gone . he broke out of the tank .
you killed them .	it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody . you saw it coming as well as i did . dodge had his plans , starting with <unk> the boat . and greer too , except he went nuts . could n't take it , i guess . could 've happened in the middle of downtown <unk> . but did it make him any less dangerous ? i do n't think so .
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody . you saw it coming as well as i did . dodge had his plans , starting with <unk> the boat . and greer too , except he went nuts . could n't take it , i guess . could 've happened in the middle of downtown <unk> . but did it make him any less dangerous ? i do n't think so .	so you killed them ?
so you killed them ?	the way i figure it , it was them or me . i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch ? bought a little time . made it look like whoever killed those <unk> was still around . but it 's just us on this ship . us and your ... spirit friends .
the way i figure it , it was them or me . i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch ? bought a little time . made it look like whoever killed those <unk> was still around . but it 's just us on this ship . us and your ... spirit friends .	and now you 're gon na kill me , is that it ?
and now you 're gon na kill me , is that it ?	i did n't want it to turn out this way .
i did n't want it to turn out this way .	murphy , do n't you see what 's happening ?
murphy , do n't you see what 's happening ?	i think i see it pretty well .
i think i see it pretty well .	it 's the ship . the ship 's making you think this way .
it 's the ship . the ship 's making you think this way .	i know a little bit about human nature and what i 've seen only confirms that .
i know a little bit about human nature and what i 've seen only confirms that .	it 's a trap . there was no way we were gon na get away with that gold . nobody ever does . it 's just the bait . this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out .
it 's a trap . there was no way we were gon na get away with that gold . nobody ever does . it 's just the bait . this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out .	i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long , with all that supernatural <unk> jumbo . there 's nothing supernatural about greed . and that 's what it comes down to , pure and simple .
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long , with all that supernatural <unk> jumbo . there 's nothing supernatural about greed . and that 's what it comes down to , pure and simple .	i do n't give a damn about the gold .
i do n't give a damn about the gold .	i wish i could believe that . either way , you know what i 've done . i 've got no choice .
greer to murphy .	go .
the number nine on the starboard side 's half flooded . epps says it 's a slow leak just under the <unk> , about twenty gallons an hour . they must 've <unk> it before we left <unk> .	of course they did .
of course they did .	let the buyer beware .
let the buyer beware .	what do you say , dodge ?
not bad for dragging a <unk> tub half way to russia .	he 'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid .
he 'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid .	i must be in the wrong business .
i must be in the wrong business .	you got that right .
you got that right .	better than `` making hamburger for mickey d . ''
red sky at night , sailor 's delight .	red sky in morning , sailor take warning .
yeah .	there 's a large vessel out about ten miles to the <unk> .
i been watching it for close to an hour and it has n't moved . i ca n't raise it on the radio either . makes me think it might be in trouble .	alright . i 'll be right up .
too deep to anchor out there .	looks like it 's <unk> .
call the <unk> ?	steer to one eight five . let 's check her out .
it 's funny .	how 's that ?
how 's that ?	besides a little rust , everything 's pretty <unk> .
murphy , goddamit .	sorry .
whatever the reason , she 's <unk> and abandoned . we 've got every right to salvage her .	you mean tow her back ? that 's a thirty thousand ton ship you 're talking about .
you mean tow her back ? that 's a thirty thousand ton ship you 're talking about .	we 've done it before .
all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it .	so we cut her loose and wait it out . a little weather could n't be anything she has n't seen before .
some classy tub in it 's day , huh ?	yeah .
morning .	you 're up late .
you 're up late .	guess i must 've fallen back to sleep . where 's epps ?
how much you figure that 's worth , skipper ?	hard to say . maybe forty , fifty million .
hard to say . maybe forty , fifty million .	ho , baby !
if they thought it was lost at sea , they probably just wrote it off .	not for fifty million . an ocean <unk> maybe . but fifty million in gold , they come looking for .
so what ? we gon na <unk> the gold and get a move on ?	we leave it where it is . stick to the plan .
yeah , but we still got ta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to <unk> .	it 's worth the effort . believe me . besides we 're gon na need her to prove the salvage .
i heard that .	dodge , you got ta get on those repairs .
what now ?	we could call for help .
we could call for help .	and get a bunch of fools <unk> ' around here ?
fifty million four ways . that 's twelve million and change a piece . what you gon na do with your share , skipper ?	not much at all , i guess . retire . live out my golden years and all that .
greer ?	moving to <unk> .
i do n't know .	let 's just take it easy here , alright ? nobody 's gon na kill anybody .
let 's just take it easy here , alright ? nobody 's gon na kill anybody .	supposing he wants to get bad with us ?
i say we <unk> some of that gold now .	would you hold on just a minute here , please ? look , there 's no reason to panic now . epps saw somebody . fine . it 's a big boat . chances 're real good he does n't even know about the gold . if we stay cool , nobody 'll be the wiser . the gold stays where it is til we 're ready to go . like i said , it 'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here .
pretty low all around .	we 'll have to take it easy then . i do n't think we 'll find much aboard the ship , but it 's probably worth looking around .
<unk> shit .	could n't have happened much more than a month ago .
greek citizen . merchant navy . obviously we are n't the first to come across this ship . they probably stumbled across it just like we did .	and look what happened .
maybe epps 's mystery man had something to do with it .	maybe .
never been more thirsty in my life .	drink up then .
how 're you feeling ?	lost my sea legs .
