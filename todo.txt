Near-term:

1) create class Dataset, which takes no config and loads only the data saved in a dataset directory
x Encoder/decoder split should be made over entire dataset, so it can be loaded in once after preprocessing, and needn't be redone with each train/test split.
2) saving/loading utilities need to be informally tested
x 'prepare' command needs to be written (i.e., args added and tested)
x (Preprocessor) class needs to be written and tested
x preprocessing needs to be tested using the command-line utility
5) a large model needs to be trained and tested to prove the (provisional) soundness of the command-line tool
6) the interactive wizards need to be sketched out and begun

Longer-term:
1) HRED model needs to be written and tested
2) VHRED model needs to be written and tested
3) Bidirectionality needs to be implemented
4) Attention needs to be implemented

Even longer-term:
1) explore knowledge-sensitive dialogue models
2) explore multi-modal dialogue models
