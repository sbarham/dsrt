# Neural DSRT: Neural dialogue systems for humans

Neural DSRT (pronounced *dessert*) is a high-level neural dialogue systems API, written in Python and running on top of familiar deep-learning (DL) and machine-learning (ML) libraries like [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), and [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn). Its key purpose is *to enable rapid development and experimentation* in a burgeoning field otherwise bereft of high-level libraries for rapid-prototyping and experimentation.

Read the documentation at [Keras.io](https://keras.io).

Keras is compatible with: __Python 2.7-3.6__.

## Guiding principles

- __User friendliness.__ Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines. It puts user experience front and center. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.

- __Modularity.__ A model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone, fully-configurable modules that can be plugged together with as little restrictions as possible. In particular, neural layers, cost functions, optimizers, initialization schemes, activation functions, regularization schemes are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models.

- __Easy extensibility.__ New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making Keras suitable for advanced research.

- __Work with Python__. No separate models configuration files in a declarative format. Models are described in Python code, which is compact, easier to debug, and allows for ease of extensibility.

## Getting started: 30 seconds to Keras

The core data structure of Keras is a __model__, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the [`Sequential`](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide) model, a linear stack of layers. For more complex architectures, you should use the [Keras functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide), which allows to build arbitrary graphs of layers.

Here is the `Sequential` model:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()
```

Stacking layers is as easy as `.add()`:

```python
from keras.layers import Dense

model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
```

Once your model looks good, configure its learning process with `.compile()`:

```python
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

If you need to, you can further configure your optimizer. A core principle of Keras is to make things reasonably simple, while allowing the user to be fully in control when they need to (the ultimate control being the easy extensibility of the source code).
```python
model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,
              optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True))
```

You can now iterate on your training data in batches:

```python
# x_train and y_train are Numpy arrays --just like in the Scikit-Learn API.
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```

Alternatively, you can feed batches to your model manually:

```python
model.train_on_batch(x_batch, y_batch)
```

Evaluate your performance in one line:

```python
loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
```

Or generate predictions on new data:

```python
classes = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)
```

Building a question answering system, an image classification model, a Neural Turing Machine, or any other model is just as fast. The ideas behind deep learning are simple, so why should their implementation be painful?

## Installation

Before installing Keras, please install one of its backend engines: TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. We recommend the TensorFlow backend.

- [TensorFlow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
- [Theano installation instructions](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#install).
- [CNTK installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/setup-cntk-on-your-machine).

You may also consider installing the following **optional dependencies**:

- [cuDNN](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/) (recommended if you plan on running Keras on GPU).
- HDF5 and [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html) (required if you plan on saving Keras models to disk).
- [graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) and [pydot](https://github.com/erocarrera/pydot) (used by [visualization utilities](https://keras.io/visualization/) to plot model graphs).

Then, you can install Keras itself. There are two ways to install Keras:

- **Install Keras from PyPI (recommended):**

```sh
sudo pip install keras
```

If you are using a virtualenv, you may want to avoid using sudo:

```sh
pip install keras
```

- **Alternatively: install Keras from the GitHub source:**

First, clone Keras using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras.git
```

 Then, `cd` to the Keras folder and run the install command:
```sh
cd keras
sudo python setup.py install
```
